g0dofi,india,101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread],"***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\**** 

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.  

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1.  The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919. 
2.  The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion. 
3.  The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries. 
4.  Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919. 
5.  On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act. 
6.  Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings 
7.  Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it. 
8.  The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi – the Sikh festival. 
9.  Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day. 
10.  The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi. 
11.  Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh. 
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16.  The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations 
17.   Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.  
18.  Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920–22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle. 
19.  Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him. 
20.  The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military. 
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113. 
22.  The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.  
23.  This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British 
24.  Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves 
25.  Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"". 
26.  Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything… When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion."" 
27.  After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government. 
28.  The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar’s Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Reginald Dyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30.  The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.  
31.  Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1.  **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 – 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940  
2. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.  
3.  While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940 
4. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained: 

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland? 

 Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).  

#  Following his conviction, he made a speech 

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism: 

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""   
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:   
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.’ Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‘We are suffering from the British Empire.’ Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‘I am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.   
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.’   
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.’ ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.’   
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct – I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.’   
>  
>""You people are suffering – workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying – British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""   
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:   
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.   
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:   
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""   
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor’s table.

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab.  On every 31 July, marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands.

g05iuj,india,My experiment with using bumble in India.,"So guys this is gonna be a bit long.                                                               
So basically I was super bored with the quarantine and I was talking to my girlfriend about random stuff. So something about online dating came up. I made a bumble profile with 3 decent pictures , a good bio ,also verified account. Guess how many matches I got ( 2 in an hour and 4 likes lol) . Bear in mind both my girlfriend and I are about a solid 9 facially  (she's a bit better maybe) but my body is  a bit above average (good frame)with slight muscle but nothing too great, but I'm on the shorter side about  5'7(I'm in South Delhi) But I certainly expected waay better results based on real life experience, I really didn't know how bad the competition is.  I wanted to see how demographics are skewed so I asked my girlfriend to send  3 random selfies  for experimenting , also none of these were taken with a proper camera(just front camera selfies) without the best lighting. Also I had no bio besides a question and my profile was unverified.  I swiped to mostly hot guys 8+, and had a 90% match rate( ridiculous). All these guys looked like models  were tall , had bodies I'd assume from more than a year of solid gymming , had great photos taken by probably a professional camera and great bio and in general had a lot of effort put on their profile all to match with a low effort unverified profile.I got 350+ likes and 100+ matches in about an hour ,hour and a half I was basically bamboozled with disparity of likes even though both of us are similarly attractive. I understand the complaints of a lot of Indian guys on bumble etc about not getting matches, but the fault is on guys and especially Indian guys y'all way too thirsty and have no or extremely low standards( bumble doesn't have a lot of white guys, almost none) the pedestalising of girls is insane. You're basically competing with Indian version of ""Chad"" if you call that if you do use online dating. The average Indian guy isn't attractive but online  there's a shit ton of ""hot"" guys in North India and most are on tinder/bumble so you'd probably get close to no matches, let alone decent ones and thats even if you're above average and have put a lot of effort in your profile. A girl in India on online dating is basically God mode. So anyone here even if you're hot guy  ( You'll probably lose your value since hot guys are dime a dozen here and fucks up the standards of all girls in general.), if you want to go for online dating.   Don't.  
1. It basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way. Basically makes it a number game which is Frankly ridiculous to me. Someone with 100+ hot guys in their profile won't be able to emotionally attach ,let alone choose between who they want. It's one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to. It's near impossible to find love where there isn't real time energy or connection involved.

2. It raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys , since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe. In real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is special(chance for a spark).  Online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encounters.(I met my girlfriend in a library, Sorry I'm a hopeless romantic)

UK

 says lucky to be alive


""I almost died,"" recalls Indian-origin Ria Lakhani, still struggling to breath normally, days after surviving a severe case of coronavirus that has killed over 7,000 people in the UK.


""It (breathing) used to be such a natural action but now I have to remember how to inhale and exhale,"" the BBC quoted her as saying from her home in north-west London.


In self-isolation, she still cannot hug her husband, or see her parents and siblings. She still wakes up at night struggling to breathe.


Lakhani, a sales executive, started to show symptoms of Covid-19 while in hospital, where she was admitted for an operation and later tested positive for coronavirus.


She said her recovery has been slow. In hospital she could barely move at first and was given morphine on top of the oxygen because of the pain.


She praised the medical staff who treated her. They are ""true heroes,"" she said.


""It was the small wins and things like the nurses making sure Iris had a constant supply of hot tea and a sneaky extra slice of cake that made me smile.""


But she's relieved that she was able to fight the virus, especially considering how many people have died.

g07a97,india,Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?,"Short version:

A  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

Long version:

I'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

g09zpm,india,Advice for vocation.,"Hi r/India! I wanted some help with figuring out how to proceed with life post-college. After this lockdown ends, I'll have to dive headfirst into a chaotic world, which will likely leave me with two options - getting a job or prepping for MBA. I'm currently in the final semester of a BBA program.

I don't want to end up in a corporate set-up. I sometimes doubt whether that's just because I'm shirking responsibility or I lack ambition but I think I have a few things figured out that I don't want to compromise on - reading and keeping a healthy life (which for me is basically an hour of running and basic exercises) and also that I don't care much for things like say, a car or a huge-ass house.

Keeping these things in mind, I wish to figure out a career which affords me this kind of a lifestyle and there's a balance between my interest in the job & the pay that I'll be getting from working it. Now that I've written it down, it sounds like it's too much to ask for but I believe it isn't entirely impossible.

g06aaf,india,What are your thoughts on arranged marriage? And marrying someone with history of mental illness?,"I think that it is very important that a person reveals about their physical and mental health issues before marriage. Otherwise it will essentially be lying / withholding information.

Most of my friends married without revealing their struggles. I am talking about both male and female friends, from big cities and towns as well.

Obviously I don't know where they will be five or ten years from now. But as of now things seem to be going well.

Obviously I don't really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives.

The mental struggles do manifest although, and could be kept hidden for only so long.

I believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others, especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines. As they can cause sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction.

So this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple. 

Other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic. So the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities. But it could be really positive too, as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well.

I myself have lived a life of honesty, so I never hide. Although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness. And they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness.

So, it tends to become a conflict of interest.

So some people decide to keep things to themselves, because others might exaggerate for fun. And it might lead to them being Ostracized. 

I personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although I want to conform with the social norms to some degree. And there always is interest of family members as well.

[https://www.thelallantop.com/bherant/ek-kavita-roz-padhna-likhna-seekho-by-safdar-hashmi/](https://www.thelallantop.com/bherant/ek-kavita-roz-padhna-likhna-seekho-by-safdar-hashmi/)

Woh Safdar Hashmi ki den hai. He was born today.

Safdar Hashmi was an activist and street theatre artist. and later identified with the communist ideology as well.

He was a turning point for street play and street theatre in India. His work highlighting human rights and grassroots changes irked many in the establishment. He openly mocked Indira Gandhi's grab of power of the Emergency, to government actions, government apathy, the plight of the poor and uneducated in India.

He was killed while performing a street play after he was attacked by the goons of the Congress party.

In later years the government, played this very song as a public campaign on Doordarshan.

Safdar was not killed due to his ideology. He was killed because he raised his voice, he mocked the establishment. He inspired people to be aware of their rights, to question.

This is the story the world over. This is today as well. TOday's deaths get whitewashed by a pliant media, that does not mean fundamental issues don't exist today. Or that we have benevolent Gods in power in the government.

Narendra Dabholkar, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare , Gauri Lankesh are grim reminders today.

g01wpp,india,"[serious] COVID-19, Help me here! where am i going wrong? (Please - I am not trying to create a panic.)","too long but please read. please do not panic over this as i may be a dumbass.

The [Mortality rate of Covid-19 in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms)  is 3.05, according to this [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms).

The mortality rate in US is about 3.57, in Italy around 12 and in UK it's more than 12.(according to the above article)

so about 3 people die per 100 cases in India. It's scary! but not too much.

currently, mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases .

    mortality rate = Total Death / Total cases

currently in world, **1,806,436** active cases and **111,722** deaths.(the curve is nowhere near flat)

mortality rate = 111722/1806436 = 6.18% worldwide.

so about 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide. It's scary! still not too much.

let's assume an [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) of 20% (20 percent of population would get infected in a span of [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif)). 25% is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didn't spread to many country as covid-19, the social distancing was not that great before and there were [three waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif).

&#x200B;

now, 20% of 7.7 billion people is 1.4 billion (very huge) and 6% of 1.4 billion is 84 million(estimated death toll). 

realistically, if the infection rate is brought down to 1%(by social distancing, lock-down, etc) the death toll would still be 4.2 million. (stay the f\*ck inside home, seriously)

&#x200B;

now, my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account( the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome.) eventually these people will either die or get cured.

Doesn't it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation?

    mortality rate = total dead / (total discharged or cured+total dead)

In this case, 

current mortality rate = 111,722 / (413,222+111,722) = 21.3% (that's huge) (numbers from [worldometer](https://imgur.com/a/E2HZnAI))

this changes everything.

now, if the infection rate is 1%(more likely estimate) the death toll would be 16.4 million.(holy f\*uck)

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history. 

In [India](https://imgur.com/a/vOkmjyH), 

mortality rate = 331/(1080+331) = 23.45% (which is very high, above world mean) (why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate?)

Did gov officials know about this?  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic?

BTW, the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the world.(as far as i researched) . they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor.

&#x200B;

please help me with these questions:

* Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable? 
* Does India have huge asymptomatic cases, which were not reported?
* How did china contain this? did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers? 
* because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries. their mortality rate (by second method - only calculating outcomes) is 4% while for the rest of the world is 21%. it never crossed 5% at any time(very suspicious). Their mortality rate is low all the way? why all the country have similar curve except china? 
* why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus?  **India should not follow Chinese model** to contain this problem.(i know medical students who are lazy to do their maths). 
* how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high .R0 = 2.2 for covid-19, based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - 34,200 in 2018/19 (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).[chinese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) ,  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - [34,200 in 2018/19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).
* how can we model this in India? will India be f\*ucked if there were a community spread?

Can we get some volunteers who can send me materials on how to model this properly? I know data science, i can make a website. with your help i can make some valuable prediction on how this will unfold and will give you that information for free.

fzs3p8,india,An Honest Conversation About Demonetization,"***Long Post Warning***

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ₹4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post.

fzfkko,india,Lives & livelihoods in India,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ₹1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now — about ₹10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ₹3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ₹3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",Policy/Economy,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fzfkko,8,1,2020-04-12 03:25:10

Me and my friends think, we will eventually have to do this in India, even after lockdown is removed. Also mass production and distribution of masks to all with take time. 

 We all have time and can contribute to this by all making a DIY mask. There are studies which clearly say that it reduces the growth rate of masks. 

We have started a #masks4allChallenge on FB and Twitter along the lines of Ice bucket Challenge which has following steps

\- Make a DIY mask  
\- Share with someone in your surrounding  
\- Tag 3 friends to take up the challenge and ask them to share in their timeline

fzzcgy,india,Endlessly refreshing for BigBasket delivery slots? Created a cross-platform program to notify you whenever a delivery slot gets available in your area.,"**Live at**: https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier

**Demo**: [Demo](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier/blob/master/screenshots/demo.gif?raw=true)

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

---
This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

If you’ve any issues in using program, or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at: [@ugupta41](https://twitter.com/ugupta41/status/1249367355769016320)

fzylo0,india,Why is accent such a big thing in India?,"Hi, I always wondered about why people (not everyone) care so much about English and Accents? 

We are taught how to read, speak and write English in school at a very young age, the whole purpose of doing that is to makes us comfortable and confident in English. English is very important in Indian education system as it's the only subject which is common all across India. Even in universites they have a separate ""Professional Communication"" course where the sole purpose of the whole course is to learn how to speak like a native speaker. And even if it is not , but still, isn't the main goal of learning a language is to speak like the natives? Like German, Korean, etc? I don't know why people judge everyone because of their accent? If you have a very good accent and speak your ""Ts and Ds"" like a native speaker then you are deemed as fake and stupid and this is only limited for English! I have never seen anyone make fun of someone who was speaking, say German or Mandarin or even French, it's only specific to English. I know how Indians born and raised outside of India are treated here, people make fun of their accent or look at them funny lol. 

On the other hand, if someone doesn't have a very good accent or has a very strong Mother Tongue Influence they are treated the same way, I'm sure you have seen a ton of videos on Facebook or Instagram where people are laughed at only because they have a very bad accent or are probably trying to learn a new language. 

I don't know why people do this? I have never seen it anywhere else, everyone has a different accent and that's how it works, you can't expect 1.3B people to have a same accent all across the country. A classic example is Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone, both are international celebrities former has an Indian-American accent while latter has an Indian Accent still I see people call then ""Fake"" and ""Cringey"" lol, why? 
Why is English a set parameter for confidence and knowledge? People in South Korea, France, Norway or Germany don't speak in English and if they do they have an accent but no one cares about it but here in India it's really complicated, you should have a accent but it shouldn't be like a native speaker but you will be shamed if you have a very strong accent as it's"" funny"", if you speak in ""English"" you are confident and more intelligent than someone who necessarily isn't good at speaking English. 

Any thoughts on this?

Tldr: Learning a new language comes with an accent, it's either good (like a native speaker) or influenced by your mother tongue. It's usually fine around the world but in India is usually frowned upon, if you don't have an ""Indian Accent"": you are fake and ""angrez"" and if you have a very strong Indian accent: you are funny, not confident enough, which gives everyone a right to judge your ""knowledge"" or ""intelligence"". There's no middle ground. This is only limited to English and not to any other languages (German, French, etc.)",AskIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fzylo0,15,12,2020-04-12 23:24:42
fzy79t,india,Help needed for a friend in Coronavirus crisis,"Hi everyone, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment. But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms.

The best discussions are when multiple functional topics revolve around one abstract topic instead of only focusing on one facet. An understanding of the abstract is woefully incomplete when only viewed through one lens.   

To get meta for a second, this is also how we should be organizing our societies with multiple functional concepts (health, mobility, commerce, government, etc) organized around one abstract concept (an individual) instead of each facet of an individual being siloed. An understanding of an individual is also woefully incomplete when viewed through only one lens.

fzvvag,india,Sad reality of Poor,"Previous year,There was a cattle dairy +ridiculous rich farmer(name be A) near my house and a family of 5 children (2(2,4class)Boys,3 Girls(8,5,1class) whose mother worked in dairy as a bonded slave(for fixed amount of time) as A has given money to the family to purchase a horse so that father can work as Raw material Carry labourers .
After some time,The family went to  Uttar Pradesh,it was decided that The 2 elder girl would work in factory to increase the family income along with mother.
(R.T.E denied by Personal Issue)

Father served 3 months as a labourer after thr family left to pay back the money.

The previous worker before the family arrived was a bonded generation labourer (Generation contact) who had 20 Bighas of self owned land , but due to Bonded labour ,he was working here while his family was on other state.

The farmer was quite powerful ,owner of Buses, Petrol pums, School, Samsung Brand shops, Super stores , perhaps that could be reason that Police doesn't act.

The thought came in my mind Reading news how woman tossed 5 children on the river in U.P.

fzus0u,india,Explainer: The proposed “zones” idea and why it is a disastrous one.,"The government is apparently floating the idea to create zones of three kinds, red, orange and green. Red zones are hotspots with 15 or more cases, and there will be no activity in them. Orange zones have less than 15 cases and they will have limited public activity, like limited public transport. Green zones have no virus cases where restrictions will be relaxed. (They’ve not yet come out with a full list of relaxed restrictions in this)

(Source: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-red-orange-green-zones-to-mark-coronavirus-spots-in-country-2210381%3famp=1&akamai-rum=off)

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don’t actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green. That means because of the virus’ 2-week incubation period and the fact that it is asymptomatic means that there will be people roaming around without realising they are infected, causing green zones to also eventually turn orange or red.

Indian msm and online it cell have turned Indian Muslims  into a punching bag for these silly frustrated people "" tired of not becoming a Superpower already well beat the pinata of Muslims"". 

Not surprised to see that people didn't question the narrative of media at all which blames Muslims even after the country has one of the lowest Testing rates so we cannot know for sure the exact sources of the outbreak and exact number of the infected but f it lets beat the pinata. 

Muslim vendors were beaten on the streets & people are being asked not to buy anything from the shops of Muslims. This madness is not surprising anymore to us.

 We are living in the times where crticizing modi and his goons isn't allowed. Media has become the mouthpiece of the government and support for Modi is equated with patriotism.

2. Moscow in his death bed would've revealed Monika was Denver's step sister 🤷🏽‍♂️

3. Professor starts taking class. The bitch Tokyo will already be messing since she hates Berlin and isn't in charge of the heist. Rio is terribly in love that he never listens to any class or keeps bunking classes and blindly listens to anything Tokyo says . Tokyo plans a riot against professor and Berlin. The plan is ruined. 

4. The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation.

5. Don't even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth, everyone would demand a privacy 😁

6. Everyone, even after the 11th day would still have the perfect hair, makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps, abs  chest etc 😃

7. Also there would be atleast a 2 dream sequence songs.

8. Boman Irani would play Arturo Roman 

9. Their hideout during the 6 month training period would be in Leh/Ladakh or Darjeeling. 

10. Dali masks to replaced by that of BigB or Sachin Tendulkar.

11. And all this Smoking /Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers.

12. After the success of Season 2. The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace Tokyo/Nairobi in the subsequent seasons.
Role of Stockholm would be reserved for a newcomer - Probably a Star Kid..Ananya Pandey or Jhanvi Kapoor?? Coz you need to reserve one for Nepotism!

I am not here to rant and rave but to show the true face of the corporate greed which clearly indicates that there's something wrong with all of this.   


To begin with, I am an entrepreneur and freelancer, having a line of credit that too with a limit of just 10,000 INR is not all that bad. However, when COVID-19 struck, I lost my clients and the due receivables from my prior clients were also stuck up. Quite reasonably, I would need to worry about my survival in a city like Mumbai and thus had whatever little I saved up in my accounts cashed due to obvious fear of not being able to pay for basic commodities. However, Slicepay through its clever legal loopholes and fuelled by its corporate hunger would not consider even a moratorium. Constant threats and random people claiming to be ""recovery agents"" have called and texted me. Even after a telephonic call with their actual staff who said I can pay it later with higher interest which I agreed to, even after that I have been completely harassed on a regular basis. 

So what is the takeaway? Well, for starters if you were thinking about this service think again. I am not an isolated example, thankfully I am a law student and caught their BS when they called my friend who also defaulted for the same reasons and said that they're in police station and are filing FIR.

fzsng3,india,Actuarial student looking for some career advice.,"Hey there internet people!

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education?

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? I am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

Please note that I am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. I was just wondering why as a country we all do this. I also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

>The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was passed by the [Parliament of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India) on 11 December 2019. It amended the [Citizenship Act of 1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_nationality_law) by providing a path to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants of [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus), [Sikh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhs), [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist), [Jain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain), [Parsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis), and [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians) religious minorities, **who had fled persecution from** [**Pakistan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan)**,** [**Bangladesh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh) **and** [**Afghanistan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan) **before December 2014**

Without getting into whether the act itself is acceptable or not, it seems to me that even if there is a Pakistani Hindu facing religious persecution today, they would not be eligible for the fast track to Indian citizenship that CAA provides.

fzjd8h,india,A Gist of Indian Innovation To Combat COVID-19,"The contagious COVID-19 outbreak has caused a catastrophic effect around the world. Countries are struggling to control and contain the spread of this disease. India, with its massive population, is making the best efforts to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The 21 day lockdown period has not locked down the creative minds of the researchers and engineers of our country. India supports all forms of innovations in the diagnosis, [treatment](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/), prevention, and spread of COVID-19.

We keep hearing many heart-touching stories of researchers and doctors working to combat this dreadful disease. Here is a gist of what the innovation community of India is up to and how our Government supports them.

##### Innovations across the Country

###### Triple-Layered Anti-infectious Gloves 

About 8.3% of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people. A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triple-layered gloves that are anti-infectious. The gloves not only protect the user’s hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves. These gloves, once opened, can be used for a maximum period of three days. The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex, while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical. The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon.

###### Anti-bacterial Clothing

[Thermaissance](https://thermaissance.com/), a startup from the GTU-incubation center, has come up with specially designed anti-bacterial clothing for hospital staff. The innovation makes use of nano silver-based technology that is capable of destroying both positive and harmful bacteria. This reduces the risk of exposure and spread of diseases among hospital staffs that are in close contact with the COVID-19 infected people. They have also come up with cheap, anti-bacterial masks tested in a NABL accredited laboratory in Mumbai for their authenticity. The masks offer 99% protection from germs even after 60 washes.

###### Colour-changing Mask

A three-layered color-changing mask to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus is at the concept stage of innovation by the [Babaria Institute of Pharmacy](https://bitspharmacy.org/). The mask prevents the entry of Coronavirus and also acts as an indicator when exposed to the virus. The membranous layers of the mask consist of enzymes and chemical reagents that can copy DNA to RNA. When the mask comes in contact with Coronavirus particles, the mask constituents react with the virus and form a solid pink color. The change in color will indicate exposure to the virus.

###### 3-D Printed Toothbrush

The innovation from the startup, Pragratham, addresses the importance of oral hygiene in the survival rate of corona virus-infected persons. This toothbrush is specially designed for COVID-19 patients in ICU. This open-source design requires a 3-D printer and cotton gauze to construct the toothbrush. It takes an hour and 45 minutes to produce a single 3-D printed toothbrush. The product has received positive feedback when tested.

###### The Quarantine Watch App

The senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil with his team in Karnataka has launched India’s first unique mobile app to facilitate active tracking of people in quarantine. The application works on both android and iPhone platforms. The home-quarantined person should download the app, fill in essential personal details, and send selfies. The system will identify good resolution selfies, and officials from the District Photo Verification team will check for the originality of the selfie. The application has also enabled GPS tracking to trace their whereabouts effectively.

###### Online Training Programme

The Karnataka Government has launched a 1.30-2.00 hour training programme to train doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The programme is freely accessible on YouTube. The programme helps doctors to prepare themselves and also teach them on specimen collection and transport, clinical management, and supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.

###### Sanitization Units

PadCare Labs, a Pune-based startup, has designed a sanitization unit to disinfect the surface area. The unit working on the principle of UV mechanism can disinfect an area of 80 sq ft with a 99.99% bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The organization will be installing the units in a local hospital soon.

###### C-CAMPs Initiatives

The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms ([C-CAMP](http://www.ccamp.res.in/)) has launched COVID-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA) to identify and support innovations that help in combating Coronavirus. The program has partnered with Social Alpha, United Nations Health Innovation Exchange (UNHIE), India2022 Xynteo, India Health Fund, MedTechConnect, AIC-CCMB, and CCMB to select innovations and develop them to large scale applications. The companies with projects towards the following criteria were nominated for funding.

###### Preventative Measures

[Anabio](https://www.anabio.ie/) Technologies Pvt Ltd works on innovating new preventative technologies that offer better protection than the existing ones. The technology from this company aims to transform a mask or a regular cotton cloth into a protective agent against Coronavirus. This technology will work on meeting the needs of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment.

###### Diagnostics

There is a rising need in India to perform mass-testing to identify and isolate people infected with COVID-19. CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd and Ampligene Diagnostics Pvt Ltd are working on developing easy-to-use, affordable, quick, and accurate diagnostic technologies.

###### Respiratory Devices

5-10% of the Indian population will require ICU in the event of community spread in India. There is a rising need for invasive and non-invasive respirators to treat critically ill patients. US FDA has approved the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines (CPAP) to meet the scarcity of ventilators. Coeo Labs and Avyantra are working on innovations in the mass production of respirators to achieve this scenario.

Many such innovations are going around in the nook and corner of our country to fight back COVID-19. Our Government has also launched several incubation programmes to encourage innovators working on combating this dreadful disease. The active contribution from young [entrepreneurs](https://www.intepat.com/blog/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-rights/) and researchers is inevitable to serve our country during this massive health crisis.",Coronavirus,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fzjd8h,9,2,2020-04-12 05:18:58

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

fz62ox,india,"(Story time) 13th Dec, 1971 - The day when Russian Nuclear warheads surfaced on the Bay of Bengal to stop USS Enterprise from attacking India","During the 1971 war between India and Pakistan for the liberation of Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan), US and UK sided with Pakistan and sent their warships to India and US. 

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

That's the reason a Russian president has never set foot in Pakistan.",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fz62ox,774,191,2020-04-11 22:13:07

fz4rsf,india,India to extend lockdown by 2 weeks,"India is set to extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks, until April 30, as its confirmed coronavirus caseload continues to soar, with no sign that the severe restrictions on most economic activities have flattened the curve.  India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to India’s hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all India’s public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.

If crores of people install it, just using wireless heahphones is enough to track your location.

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

While I see how it will allow them to back days and see whom all an affected patient came in contact with, they also see who all you came in contact with, where you were at a point in time etc.

fz16t8,india,Overpopulation - how I would go about trying to fix it,"By 2050, we are projected to add a further ~300mn more to our current 1.3bn to reach a total of 1.7bn. Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the Coivd-19 crisis. This problem is not limited to India alone, as all of South Asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

Political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - India has a dark past with population ""control"". The Indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy). In any event, I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

In my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. Participation will be totally voluntary. The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. Government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists (**BITCH**). At maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. Alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. In lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. Medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. I personally don't care for this, but most people do. In any event, Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. I think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. School/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. It's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. The best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

I want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. However, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. For instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. Naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. Having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its Aadhar database. Further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

fyxft4,india,It seems all is not well between Modi and Shah.,"Since the start of lockdown, we can observe Amit shah is totally out of the loop. As per the procedure,now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition , but Amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowhere.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama. 

We can see the notorius UP police filing FIRs on news channels on false reporting of Tabliki jamaat attendees , it was an outcome of Modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic. 

Congress has a godfather culture ,where party leaders usually don't topple their godfather.
But BJP is quite opposite where there is a culture of outsmarting their gurus., be it Modi-advani, Gadkari-fadnavis, Shivraj-Vijayvargiya., Maybe Amit shah was also planning the same and was getting bigger for his shoes, hence his wings are getting clipped .",Unverified - Opinion,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fyxft4,96,73,2020-04-11 13:43:07

2) When should one start getting emotionally attached to the \*thing\*? I mean - I don't want to be disappointed in case of a miscarriage / other complications. I am actively avoiding calling it a \*baby\* so as to not to form a bond.

fywxrt,india,"Please, help maids and wage workers","I see a lot of donation to govt. fund me for covid19 promotions. It's a great idea definitely. I have zero idea what and how they handle the donation money. How much goes to affected peoples and how much who works to collect it gets. But I say this here, there is no greater help than helping the affected directly in hand, with cold cash.

Facts why direct donation is the best:

* Instant result
* Credit goes to you, not authorities who collect the cash from you
* Lot of love from the receiver <3
* no fees, full money worth
* karma bonus points ;)
* helps keep starvation away
* more..

In this crisis times, 
they are the most affected, without work, money and lots of mouths to feed. Now most of them are penniless. This vast large number of people are isolated from our thinking bubble, living area, social bubble, social media. Where do they ask for help? Who hears their struggles! While they all just worked for our comfort, the mundane things we think we don't deserve to do! 

Our society just asked all residents to fire the maids, although i fired ours month ago with extra bonus obviously, she has two children's. I'm going to send her money again soon. I'm afraid how many lakh maid and wage worker families are starving right now. Again I have zero idea.

fywlyr,india,People who test negative might also have coronavirus: Study,">scientists have warned about a growing concern: the tests are not 100 percent reliable, meaning people with negative results might actually have coronavirus.
-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

fyoree,india,When will it be normal again?,"Anyone who thinks that there would be any revert to absolute “normalcy”, isn’t paying attention at all. 

This is here to stay. We can test however much we want, the numbers will never reflect the actual infected. This lockdown will extend for a month or two more, at least in high effected zones and then perhaps a call would be taken to phase it out depending on the severity on our health infrastructure. Most metropolitan cities would have multiple containment zones and communities would be lucky to have no cases within. 

Those worried about the economy, do realise it’s in a free fall now and only a definite cure/vaccine can bring stability to the markets. Most industries will never bounce back to its old ways. Yes many will be unemployed and yes many will downgrade exhaustively from their respective class stature. 

We can only aim to adapt to these circumstances. Fortunate are those that lived miserly as they would have their emergency fund to bid their time. But to those worried sick about bleeding money, I appeal to their creative minds, try and find ways to figure what other opportunities can be looked into while we all bid our time. Ingenuity and innovation is the call we’d need to answer to because trust me, waiting to relapse into the old business ways isn’t going to bring it to us any sooner. 

We as a nation never gave importance to a just way of funding the much needed infrastructure that would have given us the fighting chance. We have full fledged extreme class divide, a media which is complicit in advocating polarity, absolute corruption runs deep in our veins, regulations are flouted by the rich and powerful and like termite we ate into the lives of our own, the “chaltaa hai” rot bore deep and now to expect the same system to cohesively help all of us out is a fools errand. This isn’t pessimism, just plain old facts. Disaster management calls for a unified approach but just look at us, our bureaucracy is a testament to our incompetence  and non adherence on multiple levels. 

How can we expect governance to make this right when we ourselves collectively never cared for each other?

One of my relatives died (Door ke mama) from a heart attack. He was a heart patient.

The hospital in which he was admitted told his family that you have to announce to the media that he died of covid-19 or we won't give you the body. After several requests they gave the body after 3 days (maybe after taking a large amount of money, bribe or something).

This was only because he was a muslim and this happened in a small town where hindus have already stopped buying from muslims and vice versa.

I am an exmuslim myself but when I heard this, first of all it made me sad that such things are happening in times when humanity should stand together and fight (not literally because social distancing.

fyl0l1,india,What is the best western country for desi immigrants?,"A country that is most accepting and open to desi immigrants. I know europe is not that accepting and tolerant to south asian people. But I assume Canada and UK are better?

There is racism everywhere but is there a country where you will not feel like an outsider and it would feel like ""home""? Just blending in without getting any looks and weird behavior?

By accepting I mean if I live there I am Canadian or American or whatever the country is I am considered a part of it. I am not considered an immigrant anymore. I know in europe some people live their entire lives, get the nationality, learn the language and still considered an outsider by many. People are also very openly racist in europe in that they will give you looks of disgust or treat you poorly.

fyk6e8,india,A perspective about business that will help you in investment,"Let me give you some perspective of business that will help you identify shares.

When i started a company, it was hard for me to figure out , i used to campaign on my own, later i learnt ,i just have to get more people to work ,and keep getting more campaigns at higher prices.

Now,i just have to focus on two things, people and campaigns. If i have to expand my business ,i have to just increase  both . There is no such innovation needed , innovation just comes on the way. So ,the formula is so simple,you just have to focus on sales and your products. Just try to increase it . And there is no such innovation  needed to expand. You have just do more work , if you are making sales ,do more sales,making something ,keeping making more.

If the share you are purchasing, are not expanding that means they are just not doing the same work more and more ,on which their business is based on. It means they are not focused.

Take a 5 year horizon ,so if they are focused, a year is a long time ,they should increase year on year. They have to just do the same thing more and more. Its so simple. So ,if a business is not expanding , and cannot do that simple thing ,why will you ever invest in it.",Business/Finance,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fyk6e8,1,6,2020-04-11 01:22:55

fygqpd,india,Latest Indian Innovations and Funding Opportunities to Combat COVID-19,"The untapped potential of Indian youngsters is coming to light through various funding opportunities and contests organized by the Government of India. Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 – 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,” the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.”

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam’s Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user’s location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation – India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology – India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

Here is the problem. They don't live peacefully like birds. Dogs bark and make it impossible for you to walk esp at night. Sometimes they even bite you. You cannot take a walk in your street at night these days anymore. They pretty much terrorize you.

People have died and even fall off from the roof because of sudden monkey attacks. Monkeys destroy the public property esp cable system, cause faults and scare kids the most. We used to sleep on the roof at night when we were kids but it impossible to do because of all these monkeys terrorizing us.

I see people feeding them and effectively increasing their number which makes my blood boil. I feel people should stop feeding them. They all should be locked and taken to the jungle and left there forever. 

In civilized cities, there is no place for stray animals. If you disagree, tell me one reason why we shouldn't bring all other animals like deer, sheep, goats and have them live here? Can you imagine how it would be then?

In  these unprecedented times and during a National crisis,hospitals are  gearing up to provide support to the  most vulnerable who will need  blood transfusions during the COVID 19  crisis during hospitalisation.  And for other emergencies.

Hospitals  are trying to do whatever little it takes to bring emergency  care  closer to people who would need during such times through their  blood  donation camps.

Dr Ram Bhatt who  is a practising nephrologist is organising  a blood donation camp at at  apartments who can give them space (2 beds 5  meters apart in club  house) or parking space for their bus. Bus can  handle one person every  20 minutes (inlcudes the core process and  cleaning/ changing of paper  sheet time).

Please read below for more information and share with anyone you know who might able to donate within our community.

We are appealing urgently to meet requirements during COVID 19 hospitalisations.

He was even planning that If Draupadi call him for help he will cut both Dushashan hands and even fight duryodhan If needed when Dushashan was Disrobing Draupadi as that insult of women was hard for him to see.

fyf4y8,india,[Opinion] Governance and Administration participation culture must for better Electorates.,"I'm keen observer of Human Behaviour and reserve certain interest in Political System and how it shapes the Electorates.

The following views were formed earlier and had been reaffirmed when I listened to _The Seen and the Unseen podcast by Amit Varma Ep. 149 with Jayaprakash Narayan_

My view has always been to study and vote the Candidate most relevant to us, the MLA/MP of our own respective constituency. Is his primary focus on Party Worship or He also genuinely cares about the constituency and works towards it. Corruption has become inevitable evil that is to stay on account of Broken Electorate system of First Past the Post.

This method is akin to _Bottom to Top_ Approach of Management, where the Central Policy is the manifestation of Ground Reports of respective constituencies

Why do I feel is this most Important aspect that influences you're vote ?

1. Basic facilities of Sanitation, Garbage Collection, Law and Order and all such things are all the product of the local machinery in place. The Centre is an instrumental force in steering the Public policy. The real groundwork is laid by the local administration that has the task of implementing it.

2. It helps the Voter be a real part of Voting process as he is voting for a Candidate that'll tackle the issues that are of direct concern to him. It ensures that there is direct impact of the Vote he casts.

3. It helps in selection of Responsible Candidates who know that only real time work will lead to ensured retention of his office. And that an active voter base will have a scorecard in hand that will evaluate his performance time to time.

4. It will inculcate a culture of sustained Politics - direct involvement in decision making process of the constituency and nation building, opposite to the form now where it is goes into slumber at the end of an election cycle.

This is not a foolproof method to root out all evil of the Broken Electoral System. But I consider this a nudge in certain direction, maybe a base for greater changes in future.

For/Against opinions if any are always welcome, I'll take this as another learning opportunity.",Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fyf4y8,4,2,2020-04-10 20:37:59

fycg7l,india,Questions on my mind because of the lockdown and the pandemic that’s still at large.,"1) Read that China 🇨🇳 ended their lockdown a few days ago, how does that work exactly? There’s no cure for Covid-19 yet.. what’s to stop anyone there from catching it again and repeating the cycle? 

2) PM cares relief fund : been getting a lot of forwards/ seeing praised on social media about who donated what amount and all... I thank them sincerely. Also, what’s happened to that amount? How is it being utilised and who’s benefiting from it? 

3) Jobs that aren’t paying salaries to their employees. How are those people and their families supposed to get by? How will they pay rent, bills and loans? (I know some banks have paused collecting EMIs for 2-3 months, but that communication was made via E-mail, I don’t think the majority of Middle Aged and Senior citizens would update themselves by checking their mailbox) 

4) I live in Bangalore and once A week, I  go to get essentials and each time, I see that the main road is sort of packed even during late afternoon and people are just sitting outside closed shops and are basically chilling, idk why the seriousness of this disease isn’t getting to everyone yet? And also the panic buying during each announcement of any lockdown or curfew. It’s less survival of fittest, and more survival of the douche-est. 

5) And that HCQ drug, what was that drama even for? It was evident he’d get it since Trump and Modi are basically FaceTime buddies at this point. 

6) The govt has been announcing different things (hold off rent, pay salaries, free ration, random people spraying things in “main roads” who also don’t know what they’re spraying), anyways.. when are these things getting implemented? What is the solution for the middle class people who need that salary or have to pay rent? 

7) Why are they locking out pet food? Cz my local shop was pretty empty when I went in last week and had to buy different brands of food cz they were out and claimed that no new stock is coming in till this is clears up.

Our Process:
1) Requests received from hospitals are put in queue after verifying it is sent from a legitimate email address from a person in authority.  
2) We ask the hospital to get a quote from their vendor for the quality and quantity they need.  
3) We allocate funds for this as per the current amount raised and pay the vendor who will deliver the goods directly to the hospital - this will be against a GST invoice.  
4) Once a hospital receives the goods we will request them to share pictures and it's acknowledgement.  

So far we are working with the Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital (Delhi) and Hindu Rao Hospital. Urgent items required by them are PPE Kits (10,000 required), ICU PPE Kits (1,000 required) and Sanitisation Tunnels at hospital entrances.  

Two requests I want to make from r/india ->

fyawwo,india,I built this tweet generator app for left-wing & right-wing Indian twitter (URL: http://botbaby.in/),"I have generally been concerned about the way social media has been evolving in recent times. Esp. twitter with all the polarisation, fake news/trends, BOTs, trolling/abusing etc. Always wanted to do something about it. I am also a Machine Learning practitioner, interested in NLP, so I thought I can combine the two and build a few apps around it.

I am working alone so there is only so much I can do. More over I have to also balance it with doing stuff that would help me professionally.

So as I first step, I made a tweet generator app, that is trained on left-wing and right-wing Indian twitter. Idea is to drive home the point of falling social discourse, that if we don't do anything about it, this is how our kids will learn to speak.

You can try the app here: [http://botbaby.in/](http://botbaby.in/)

All the tweets are machine generated. None of them really exist, not even the individual sentences.

Please note that, if you enter a new prompt, then it needs to do inferencing (which involves starting a GPU machine) which can take upto a minute. While if you select an existing prompt then results would be returned immediately.

Please provide your feedback. All comments and suggestions are welcome esp, what further apps you think can be built to tackle the menace of social media. I have my own ideas but always good to get a few more of them.

fyawr9,india,"The need to investigate the NSO Group, which was behind the Pegasus software, is now more than ever.","&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, “discovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app’s phone call function.” As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group  is “actively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.”   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors  like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

People avoid me and I avoid people. 


Issue is, it's kinda hard to be alone all the time. But I also don't want to change because frankly, people never change. 

I am also a danger to people around me so even my mom agrees to an extent that it might be good that no girls even like looking at me much less like me. So, despite her lifelong wish of seeing me married someday, some part of her doesn't want to get me married. 

Plus even if I did get married I don't want kids. And since this is India and not some western country, almost zero women would want a childfree life.


Anyway, tldr is that It's probably better for me and people around me that I spend my life alone, but at times I just can't take the fact that I don't have a girlfriend or even friends to talk to.

So how do I strengthen my mind so that I don't feel lonely or bad about any physical needs and stuffs. I just want to shut off the world and my own sexual desires completely so that my mind can be freed a bit.

PS: I actually view women as nothing more than sex machines. I guess I'm no different in than sex abusers and molesters.  But since I don't want to become a criminal and a news headline, I try to stay clear of shit.",AskIndia,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fy0s1a,10,24,2020-04-10 05:11:40

Translation : 

&#x200B;

The streets were completely deserted.

Was unaware of my innocence.

The calamity that came

From the huts to the havelis were disturbed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All were imprisoned in their nests,

The flight of the bird was free.

Everyone cares about their loved ones,

Here my mother was upset with my hunger

Was a father,

Part of which was more sin than virtue.

Drunk of the morning item,

Pete was at night in the myth of Pete manhood.

&#x200B;

More than death, she was afraid of her God,

Perhaps that's why she used to stay at work all day.

Now sobs were also slow due to beating of weeks,

My mother was in a prison with a sinner. 

&#x200B;

Ration at home was also less,

More than an empty stomach, conditions were lost.

Don't know who was guilty of this plight,

To my ignorance, the government was the soldier of the street.  


&#x200B;

Days were passing like months,

Was waiting for help, sorry for the poor.

Now guess what, what to tell, was government business,

The months have gone by.  


Then some angels came every day,

Seemed to have come in search of a poor.

Four cameras were also brought with half a kilo of potatoes,

Did not know that they had come to give something, or had come to buy self-respect.  


It was heard again and again that the poor thing is poor,

Not everyone will be able to give it to those who are close.

Someone's eye on me too,

Leave it to the voice, it is a favor, it is a strange addiction. 

Knowing in a prickly heart that I am poor,

&#x200B;

Then there was also a feeling of how close to reality I am

A question also arose in the mind,

palace had come to my hut to erase the lust of their virtue,

Then how am I poor?

fxxq6i,india,How is everyone enjoying the clean air? What can be done to keep it clean in the future?,"I’m sure many of you have noticed how much the air quality has improved during the shutdown. It is all over the news right now. 

If people want it to stay this way, changes will need to be made. But it’s clearly not possible to implement US style exhaust catalysts made of platinum and which cost almost as much as a new car in India. What alternatives are there to using expensive exhaust catalysts? 

About a decade ago the US experimented with natural gas trucks. Hundreds of thousands were produced. The experiment failed not because the trucks did not work, but because the corporations which owned them turned down the power to save fuel and this made drivers refuse to drive them. They could not drive safely with such little power on such heavy vehicles. 

The trucks actually worked well when they were not restricted with poorly conceived programming from office workers who had no idea what they were doing. 

These systems are already proven and can be installed on existing trucks. In fact, there are thousands and thousands of them sitting idle on dealer lots in the US right now. If the government or companies wanted to try them out they would not even need to spend anything on development. It’s already developed. They can simply install existing systems or import cheap US trucks nobody wants. Just remember to use proper programming and drop the corporate nonsense. 

**As an added bonus, adopting these systems would also allow India to use its large natural gas reserves instead of having to import diesel. India imports 82% of diesel.**

fxwhmv,india,Calling all the app developers to help fight depression,"We all know that in this world of corona virus people are more depressed because of job losses, domestic violence, uncertain future etc.

I basically want to make an app where people can seek free counselling / talk to someone . 

The app just connects people who want to talk/ vent their heart out with people who want to listen and allows them to chat over text. No video, audio , image sharing , emoji bs. 

You must be like why would anybody want to listen because many people  are bored with all forms of social media and want to have a real connection. 

Why would a person talk because sometimes somethings is bothering them and they do not have a proper outlet / person to talk especially who doesn't judge them or thinks they are crazy.

Truth be told I did make such a app in the past with my own hands and it sucked bad. I had a lot of connection issues, privacy issues , security holes, trolling and lack of beta testers and got my hands burned. 

You can see /r/247buddy to see how bad it was.

This time  I want to fund this app and seek app developers who believe in this cause. 

Right now as per my research there aren't proper apps out there, people think suicide hotline  is the only option. 

You may ask I should reach out to Deepika Padukone and her ngo but I feel they have done a poor job in promoting what they do infact they haven't done much.  And their hotline isn't that amazing.

In my app the listeners will have to register and have to go through a basic vetting process. The vetting process will be in adherence to the guidelines set by our counsellors . I am trying to reach out counsellors for this.

Note this app will be free to use and on top of that I don't expect to make a single dime out of it. Yes It has to be non profit as I know my audience they cannot  afford to talk to counsellors.


So based on what I said I hope the app developers who contact me aren't expecting too much money from this. I don't mind paying for your coffee/pizza and internet bills nothing more than that.

fxvqao,india,Scared..,"18 M


I don't know if it's allowed to post this here but I don't know what to do ....I'm scared shitless right now. 

Basically I'm having a crisis .... 

I'm having intrusive thoughts about well ... Scary things .....

It started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . Though I'm not doing anything suspicious.... But I still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... 

That escalated to ""maybe I am actually a criminal"" ... This seemed like an irrational thought but I started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe I'm an insane criminal etc . And that this world is a hallucination and that in reality I'm a criminal... I'm still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... That I'm going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....

Now the fear is because of a dream I had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that I'd be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that I would hurt them too . Or maybe that I was never loved and that I wouldn't be able to return to my loved ones

And that I'd lose everything basically .... Which really scared me a lot . And in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like Ryuk from the Anime Death note , mocking me . I was scared for some time but the fear subsided . Now I'm getting scared even more ... Because some details in that dream became true ... Like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... But I was scared that that wouldn't be an end to it . It seems similar to right now...... Which is really scary 

Especially the ""not returning to loved ones part"" 

Most of my friends are online and I'm in a long distance relationship ..... And because of those anxieties , I haven't contacted them ..... And I've been scared shitless ...... 

Many of the other things I'm noticing are ""signs"" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that I take as ""warnings"" ......  And some bad things happening with me lately .... Even my mom is acting weird ... This all seems determinential ..... It's so scary .... Thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......

I even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like Babylon and Hell girl ....... 

Because of which I'm unable to let my guard down ....

And it's really scaring me ......

Even if most relegions might not have hell ... I'm scared of there being a different hell .... From relegions ... That is eternal .... It's really scary and ruining my health

I'm scared of this possibility and don't know what to do ....",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fxvqao,42,27,2020-04-10 00:40:24

fxuzbv,india,Why do we believe in God?,"Have you really seen God? Then why do you believe in him? I came out with 3 reasons for it.

1. Age old manuscript/knowledge and books:

So, we are passed on from Generations the books like Gita, Bible, and Quran and many others. And people telling it from so long. The story of Ram and Krishna passed on through ages. It’s true or not, it does not matter. It was so beautifully written and embedded that even its not true. It’s worth considering. And no one can prove it wrong anyhow, why? that we will discuss in the third point.

2. Exceptional bliss, fortune or lottery:

So, there are times people experience, so-called God bliss. By that, I mean a person facing a lot of issues in life may be due to a different person or someone. And after some time, like a lottery everything becomes fine, everything is so great around.

I think this happens with most of the people around. And that is how I think life is a game of probability that is not evenly distributed or maybe it is even. It’s like someone is so happy, someone is so rich, someone life is getting turned at this very moment, someone is poor, someone is going to die after a second of birth.

Its all a game of probability, opportunities are probable, sometimes it is such that you hit a six at times when you are at the worst part of life, and you believe there is an external force acting and yes, it is. It is the force of probability.

And yeah, you may think it doesn’t happen with everyone, its probability, It happens with some people, so why everyone still believes in God. It’s because, if it happens to one, and the one is watched by many. So, everyone thinks, ya there is some force and there is some God. Maybe there is…

3. You cannot prove something, that doesn’t exist:

So, a great philosopher. I don’t remember exactly who, once said if anyone asks you, do god exists or not. You can say yes, it exists. Why?

Because if God exists, you are right. And if he doesn’t exist, then you can never prove something that doesn’t exist. Like if I say, I am seeing a God, a unicorn or something in this room, and even if it exists or not. You will say it does not. But in this infinite, exponentially expanding universe, that you cannot see, how will you prove that a thing/force does not exist. You cannot prove negativity. You cannot prove things that don’t exist. You can only prove things that exist.",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fxuzbv,15,32,2020-04-10 00:00:28

This is morally wrong, unethical but sadly it is not illegal in [India](https://indiacorplaw.in/2020/03/price-gouging-in-the-age-of-coronavirus-an-analysis-of-the-regulatory-strategies.html) . This affects the people in the medical field the most as they are the ones who depend on these products the most.

All doctors are risking their lives by treating patients during this pandemic and they get screwed by the public. One day everyone was clapping which was originally planned as a gesture of appreciation for doctors and nurses. The next day we get news about [stone pelting](https://english.jagran.com/india/coronavirus-outbreak-health-officials-attacked-in-indore-during-covid19-patient-tracking-two-injured-watch-10010285) which had happened on doctors .Majority of the people of these country always had a certain hatred for doctors and the current situation would only intensify their hate towards them.

Most medical shops seemed to have closed down but in reality they have hijacked the cost of all the medications to 10-20 times their original price and are selling these essential supplies secretly. This is all really messed up that some people are trying (and succeeding) to profit  off of this.

When the doctors ask the government for help I think the government laughs at them. When there is an acute shortage of PPE, [the government has exported them to Serbia](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/even-as-docs-use-raincoats-india-exports-suits-to-serbia/articleshow/74957518.cms).

Currently, the labs are supposed to test the patients for free and incur the loss as they themselves have to purchase the testing kits.

I have been in home isolation for a while and today went out to buy groceries and random food products.

The price increase is about Rs.4 to Rs.6, which is not much but I don't like the fact that they are taking advantage of the crises and people needs. 

These items not necessarily comes under essential goods but I think its still not right. When I ask about it they get easily agitated saying ""lena hai to lo ya jao"" and reasons like high demand are the replies.

Step 1 - Collect samples of 15 people. 

Step 2- Mix all of them together and do one single test. 

Step 3 - Output has two scenarios

Scenario 1 - If the test is positive - Do individual tests of all the samples.

First we wash them with a solution of water and baking soda/salt and then keep them to dry in the sun for an hour or two. And then the person who went out to get the stuff(which is mostly me) has to immediately take a bath and wash the clothes as well.

fxrbz1,india,"I have a feeling that, just like Kerala, rest of India will flatten the curve at around 10,000 cases because we’ll never test community spreading cases at all.","
 According to ICMR our current testing strategy is: 

* All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days:

* All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

* All symptomatic health care workers.

* All hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath).

* Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.

It’s crystal clear that we’ve a very restrictive testing criteria that only tests NRIs, foreigners and people who’re in direct with these people, including medical staffs. We are completely masking the community transmission of corona virus, since people who were directly in contact with those people might have come in contact with hundreds of other people. 

An example of this would be recent Nizamuddin Dargah and Shradhdha ceremony incidents where government only quarantined only those people who were directly involved in the events but those who attended these event might have further spread the virus to several other people, Several thousands or way more to be specific. 

One of the attendee of Jamat was a grocery shopkeeper in my uncle’s town, he was recently taken into custody. So, he alone might have come in contact with thousands of people before he was taken into custody. 

Also, last week 2 people died from corona virus in Dharavi slum, where millions of people are jam-packed in a tiny area, they use the same water-taps and toilets, apparently the government only tested 70 people in that slum and 15 tested positive. Which is no-where near the actual numbers, those 15 people might have come in contact with several hundreds or thousands of people in their own slum. 

If this goes on, I believe we’ll completely ignore the community transmission and the fact that “asymptomatic carries” of corona virus are the biggest cause of cases increasing exponentially in developed countries. 

I don’t think, Kerala flattening the curve is something to be happy about (yet). Since, they’ve started rapid testings to check community transmission I believe that might give us a clearer picture of the situation.

Edit: yesterday, they’ve added the criteria of testing symptomatic people, to check community transmission. Hope, it brings a more accurate statistics of infected cases.

fxprae,india,SC issues notice in FMP's petition seeking restoration of 4G internet in J&K during COVID-19 crisis,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ez9fp6o2mrr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8321de6fea93331bdee6b452fb7f61a38c7d9960

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on [**03 April 2020**](http://jkhome.nic.in/22(TSTS)of2020.pdf) and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

&#x200B;

[J&K Doctor's Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/e1f5q5p6mrr41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=61108bdc3b92f1d06a78a65a45332d2067dca842)

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient. 

&#x200B;

[J&K Teacher's Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/ybr8hgv8mrr41.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=506f18b04aa10488edac202d812b8740ff515a54)

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF’s Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today’s hearing which happened via video conferencing.

fxpcir,india,Is this a good deal?,"Hey guys.
Hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
It's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one I'm going to ask now but I really need your help. 
So here's the scene. 

I've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. Basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

It's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. This firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come September. 

Upon speaking to the founder, I found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. We have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

Here's a rough idea of the deal I'm getting offered. 
He's offering me an equity stake in the company. (The valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
My rent and meals will also be taken care of. Transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
In addition, I've asked him that I would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (Sutta, daaru etc) 
This startup is based out of Delhi. 

What I want to know is this a good deal? I've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

I do want to join this startup. It offers me responsibility, and I'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

What I'm confused about is the deal that I'll strike with them. How much equity stake should I ask for? How much salary should I ask? ( They're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
Any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and I can start work at the earliest. 

Please help out a brother in need!

fxp1uj,india,Filtered whole house air exchanger : DIY?,"Had an idle idea for a DIY project to be done post lockdown, thoughts on this? During summers apartments get quite hot during the daytime, and night time temps are typically 5-10 degrees lower. At night (around 11pm-midnight) the indoor temp is often 5 degrees or more higher than the outdoor temp. Opening windows to promote air exchange is a rather slow process and also results in dust coming in, hence we end up running an AC for 20-30 min to cool just one room. 

&#x200B;

Instead, is it practical to have a high volume intake fan attached to a window, with a HEPA filter. Run this intake fan for a few minutes to flush out the air inside the room with fresh air from outside through the filter. This would instantly cool the room to the outside temp, and also instead of running an AC consuming 1000-1500W, the initial reduction would come from a fan consuming 100 watts or so.

fxj7u5,india,CS career question: Leaving lesser known company in 4 months of joining for Amazon,"I work at a lesser known company in India as SDE. Joined fresh out of a good college at okay salary (around 14 LPA total compensation). Never got a chance to interview for Amazon in college so took a chance and interviewed and got selected(the interview wasn't very difficult and I didn't do very well in the difficult round)

Pros:
The increment I am getting in my current compensation is huge (9+ lakh, this includes bonus as well with base around 16), not counting the stocks
I am also getting a brand name for my resume
Work on higher scale. Also, current company has lots of tech debt and not a very clear plan for future whereas Amazon's team looks good
Current company is not growing very fast and although we have been assured no layoffs due to corona, I don't exactly trust the senior management
I will have better opportunities ( non tech as well) at amazon

Cons:
Leaving so early makes me look greedy for future employers

I love the culture at my current team ( no on-call, friendly people but not exceptionally knowledgeable)

I work much more efficiently (for 12 hrs daily currently and like it) and am very deadline oriented but in a friendly environment where there's not much anxiety about getting fired which I believe is opposite of Amazon's culture

With this high salary there would surely be higher expectations as fresh grads who will join with me will be getting 20% less base than me so what if I can't get the job done and I won't even be able to leave in case things don't work out as I already would have left current company in 4-5 months

fxnpwr,india,[Serious] How do you create political awareness?,"The recent times have revealed as much about politics as it did about viruses. I cannot get my head around people’s perceived notions about democracy, rights, and political affiliations.

Rather than holding the government accountable, people are cheering for the subpar measures during this epidemic. We are still not testing enough people to know the actual count. Due to the lack of resources, only people with travel history/confirmed contact are being prioritized. Social distancing is neither being followed or enforced. Stranded migrants, police brutality, economic crises are rarely mentioned in the news. Fake news continues to spread like wildfire long before it is dispelled.

While these are the pressing issues, the media has made it a BJP vs Congress tirade. TV debates are presented by loudmouths that only feed delusions. Supporters on both sides blame the other first chance they get. How exactly do you make them understand that accountability matters and it is an utter disservice to the nation to follow a party blindly?

Parties have dug their claws deep inside peoples’ minds through social media and WhatsApp. How exactly can we create political awareness in the public so that the govt knows it will be held accountable? Can there be any technological solution? Does it have to be a community effort? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

edit. answer by TintinQuarantino420 is very comprehensive
> There are two phases for Swiggy
1.) Before order is accepted by the restaurant : If the customer cancels before that, then the customer gets the complete refund. Restaurant doesn't get paid anything.
2.) After the order is accepted by the restaurant : Customer will get only x% of amount as refund the remaining (100-x)% is given to the restaurant after swiggy commission
3.) Outlier cases : Customer has fought for a genuine reason (order too late etc) then comes 2 cases again
a.) Restaurant has marked food ready but delay is from delivery partner assignment:(this will apply to the case you mentioned, but delivery partner not being available is an almost impossible case)
Swiggy bears the complete cost of cancellation
b.) Restaurant is delaying food prep :
Restaurant bears the canceling charges given as refund to the customer.
If restaurants mark food ready without it being ready, a common pattern of cases will result in a penalty on the restaurant.
If, there is something different about food prep time compared to what historical data suggests about the restaurant then it will be investigated with the restaurant needing to bear cost unless it can genuinely prove otherwise.

***LOCK – ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would’ve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world’s population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today’s situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren’t performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, “Out of Adversity comes Opportunity”. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‘Home’ is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector’s growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India’s GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector’s contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India’s GDP by 2025.

· **Real Estate – Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India’s Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

· **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

· **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

· **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

· **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

· **Long Term “Assured” Wealth Building Asset with “Predictable “ Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **“Predictable” Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an “Assured” Capital Appreciation in long term**, don’t be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company’s stock price or your bank’s health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

· **“Helps you Raise Money Quickly”** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

· **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **“Wine and Real Estate improve with Age”** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

· **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

· **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

· **Co-living market** size across India’s top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

· **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

· India’s improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why –**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand – Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it’s time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor’s portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual’s cash flow and wealth.

**“BUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don’t WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**
