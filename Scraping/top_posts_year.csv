f9outu,india,Fuck all Religion,"Fuck all religion. Fuck Hindusim, fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck Buddhism. Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

dcnhz2,india,"Pakistani here, hear me out","I turn on Pakistani news channels  and I see news anchors and politicians saying things like ""we always wanted peace, India doesn't want peace"". I turn on Indian news channels and everyone says ""we always wanted peace, Pakistan doesn't want peace"". 
The media is clearly not truthful on either sides and have been manipulating citizens of both countries for years. 
I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.
We all watch cricket together and recently when India and Pakistan were versing each other we were all having a great time.
Politics and media has ruined us.
Peace and love,
From a Pakistani

We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics. This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose, and worship in any way we please.

fuug0q,india,"I've never felt so helpless, please help our family.","I've posted twice before on this community and they have helped me immensely both the times. My father suffered a near fatal stroke and his recovery has been slow. We took discharge from the hospital and due to the rising cases of covid-19 and also the doctor suggested to take him home. 

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well. 

The doctors have suggested there may be pneumonia or positional collapse involved in this case. 
Our family really is in dire need of your help.

drehup,india,Whats with this country and its standards?,"Apart from the obvious, trash everywhere, bikes on pavements, honking 24x7 even on empty roads, screaming yelling on streets for no reason, and even full-on riots when popular people die of natural causes (rajkumar in south india), even businesses are complete garbage.

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

* Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

e69fln,india,Possible scam on the huge Youtube tech channel PhoneRadar. I am the winner. Need advice,"Hello everyone,

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

ciddbn,india,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

My father forced me to join mechanical engineering with copious amount of sharma ji ka beta dialogues. after scoring a 0 in math test I dropped out . Next year I joined a bsc course and dropped after 6 months.

&#x200B;

In 2013 I started short term/day trading using my fathers account and did it for a year. While reading a Japanese comic I came across warren buffett's name. After reading 'The intelligent investor' I decided to do long term stock investing. I have been investing for 5 years. a year ago I had a portfolio of 59 lakh of which 45 belonged to my dad and 14 was mine. after a fight with my dad i had to stop investing as it was his account. 2months later he agreed to give me my 14 lakh and told me to gtfo.

&#x200B;

6 months back my mom got a bulge in her l4-l5 lumbar spine. my dad refused to pay for her treatment so i had to chip in.

right now my portfolio is at 10.5 lakh.

I can only read and write in english. I can speak in hindi, tamil, telugu, english.

I am trying to learn python on my own. I have started to jog for 30min every day.

ffyots,india,My Covid-19 quarantine experience,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

d0em6s,india,I finally convinced him. That awesome moment when you understand the essense of life,"A little long story.  I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

Name of boy - Ivaan

Have a blessed day all!

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

I issue a first class pass but as there were only 20 people I joined the queue and waited for my turn. A lady came rushing and went straight to the window , at this moment 10-12 mins must have passed and queue was growing as 2 major trains depart and morning rush hour had begun.
I requested her to join the line and got a reply “train is about to come , will miss it” . I said everyone waiting is to board the same train and I informed the ticket guy to not issue a ticket to her. At last she had to leave and she shouted the words “Idiot bastard” and rushed away shedding her pride. Am I the idiot/bastard in this case ? Why do people get offended when they are being simply told to explain simple rules every citizen has to follow. I know this is very common but I am more offended coz of her retaliation. Also I don’t know why 80% of us don’t speak up against these literate fools who think they have the right to oppress other fellow citizens.

He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

fp83fz,india,"Goa is STARVING due to 100% lockdown, and I need you to know about us","I cannot take this anymore! The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue:

e5rae3,india,Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.",Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/e5rae3,1628,353,2019-12-04 09:12:26

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren’t that many but they’re increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn’t. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate ‘flu clinic’ and don’t even see the face of the screening centre. I don’t know whether the government can’t afford the testing kits or it doesn’t want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I won’t test them. They’re frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor.

e8tyev,india,I shall not keep quiet.,"Since I was a child I was taught to conjure hatred towards Pakistan. For it was a nation who discriminated against religion. For it was a nation who fueled terrorism against said religion. And so I did. 


* I rejoiced when their prime minister got imprisoned. 

* I rejoiced when their image in the world was reduced to a terrorist nation. 

* I rejoiced each time our cricket team won against theirs. 

* I rejoiced when their diplomatic relationships were shattered. 


As I walked in the mist of ignorance rarely did I see the hypocrisy of my own country, and how could I? It was so pure and true. How can Mother India be anything but holy? 


And as the mist grew thick, I saw the hate crimes against the Muslims of our country. I felt infuriated for I was taught to conjure brotherhood towards all the people of my beloved country.
But how could I? 
*Was I not supposed to discriminate against the Muslims for that is what my ever so righteous parents did?*
All I was but a green child, and so I kept quiet. 



* I kept quiet as they were killed for eating beef. 

* I kept quiet as their fortunes were stripped away by the mobs of unruly. 
* I kept quiet as the government increasingly drifted away from harbouring secularism. 
* I kept quiet as hate crimes became rampant.
* I kept quiet as students were harassed. 



But now the Eastern wind blows wild and the mist falls. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I grow grave with fear that my beloved country is becoming the very thing I was taught to despise. 

*Was I not taught the virtues of secularism? 
Was I not taught the value of equality? 
How can I let my country become the pit of what it stood on?*


# No, I shall not keep quiet any longer.

Thugs in front of me start a fight with me unprovoked because I did not stand up for the national anthem.

I get hit on the face and they incite a crowd against me. They close in and shouting threats to my life.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

Also for disclosure, I did unload an unholy fuckton of insults and swears on the thugs and subsequent audience that went after me, they were all triggered.

f0ky4m,india,[Serious] He flew to India and ghosted me. Found out he got married. Please help me understand the culture.,"Sorry if this isn’t the appropriate place to post this.

I’m an American who was dating a guy from India. We’re both in our late 20s, he’s Catholic, from Kerala, and we had been dating for over a year.

He flew to India to visit his family last September. He said he wanted to go early in the year so that we could spend Christmas and New Years together. But instead he started ghosting me for a couple of weeks and when I wouldn’t stop texting him as I was worried, he finally replied with a long breakup text. He said his parents were retiring and so he was moving back to India forever to help his parents move, and said he had no choice but to break up with me and wants me to move on.

I recently found out from his Whatsapp photo that it wasn’t true at all…in reality he just got married, and he's still working in the states. I have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message -- his text was the last piece of communication between us.

I’ve read in passing that it’s not unheard of for NRI's to dump their foreign girlfriends right before they tie the knot with someone in their community, so easily like it’s some sort of past time. And then it becomes this deep dark secret they laugh about with their mates after work. Please tell me this isn't true? When I told our mutual Indian friend about this, he (the friend) was more in disbelief/shock by the fact that it happened to me rather than *what* had happened.

I’m torn between feeling devastated vs. feeling pure anger and hatred like I was just manipulated by a sociopath for over a year. We were each other’s best friend, we loved each other, made a bunch of other forever-promises that couples do… Or was he just practicing for his future wife...",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/f0ky4m,1387,416,2020-02-08 10:08:47

ewjz8z,india,Watch Republic. Screenshot every ad that comes on screen. Let's put all their logos in one image.,"There is only one way to pull the plug and it is not through just outrage. As many have pointed out on Twitter, Republic relies on advertising. Brands who advertise there directly benefit from the dog-whistle, communal, inflammatory content that Republic broadcasts.

The image of the Jamia shooter is already ingrained in everyone's mind. 

All we need to do is ingrain a few logos along with Republic so we know who funds hatred.

The goal is to present an accurate picture of who is funding this violence. When the optics turn even slightly bad, the brands will do the rest.

Can we make a Google Drive with the relevant information—or something on an anonymous platform? It needs to go out on Twitter quick while the pan is still hot.

bqu5mh,india,"TIL in 2004, around 200 women barged in a Nagpur district court with chilli powder and knives; his penis chopped off and Akku Yadav was lynched to death in front of the judge. He had 88 cases against him which included rape, murder, attempt to murder, gangrapes, extortion, etc. in the last 14 years.","Sept. '05 - The Guardian: ['Arrest us all': the 200 women who killed a rapist. 
When hundreds of women descended on Nagpur district court armed with knives, stones and chilli powder, within minutes the man who raped them lay dead. Raekha Prasad reports](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/16/india.gender)

> At 3pm on August 13 2004, Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around 200 women from Kasturba Nagar. It took them 15 minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade. Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled. As he flailed and fought, one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife. A further 70 stab wounds were left on his body. The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting. Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum, but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court.

> Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav, the women took the law into their own hands. A local thug, Yadav and his gang had terrorised the 300 families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade, barging into homes demanding money, shouting threats and abuse.

> Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks. They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times. Each time he was arrested, he was granted bail.

> He violated women to control men, ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as 12 to a nearby derelict building to be gang-raped.

>  Prominent among their supporters were 100 lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused, but as the victims. 

> *One retired high court judge even congratulated the women. ""In the circumstances they underwent, they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku. The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security. But the police failed to protect them,"" said Justice Bhau Vahane.*

> On the day of Yadav's hearing, 200 women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder. *As he walked in, Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped. He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her. The police laughed. She took off her sandal and began to hit him, shouting, ""We can't both live on this Earth together. It's you or me.""*

djperg,india,"Hello r/India ns, Please don't sacrifice your life for your work","I witnessed someone's life getting destroyed because of work pressure and urge all of you to not do that. 

I had a colleague who was  bit obsessed with his work. He would stay late hours in office to work. This all was fine until he was single. He got married last year. Even for wedding he took leave of only five days. Even after marriage his staying late at office continued. His wife, being alone at home all days, thoughts started creeping into her mind that he might be having some affair in office. (She got female colleagues number somehow, called her and asked her questions such as ""Is there a really too much work at office? , who all stay late at office?"" Like that.) 
Within six months of marriage she filed for divorce. Now this guy, he went into depression and started being late to the office,he wouldn't complete his work on time cause he was always distracted. He started receiving flak for it in the office. He became more n more depressed. He had accident few months back, I don't know but maybe because he was distracted while driving.   
Today he was let go because of poor performance. 

Devoting yourself to the work is good. But, be aware there is life outside of the work. There is your family who loves you. Do not neglect them for work. Because, if it comes to it your employer will replace you within 3 months(notice period😅). 

That's all I have to say. Thank you for reading.

Tldr: witnessed persons life getting destroyed because of work pressure. Wrote this to remind you that there is life outside of office.

ckinsv,india,"Sexual assaults against women are increasing because we only see women only as sister or mother or wife, never as an individual with her own identity.","Many make the argument that women are sacred in India, we have female goddesses, which none of the other major religions do. But I would like to point out that it is infact increasing the problem, not solving it. We are trained to see a single woman only either as a sister, or a mother, or a wife, but never in the form of a lover or as as individual in herself (terming sister,mother,wife attaches a relationship with someone, depriving them of their own identity). Even take the case of Radha, she was lover of Krishna, but she is most commonly worshiped as Radhe Maiya.

dxxls6,india,"All the gym goers of r/India, DO NOT follow your gym trainer's advice blindly.","I have been to many commercial gyms in India and what I have seen in most of the gym is that the trainers do not have any clue whatsoever how to perform basic exercises correctly. They will just shout cues at your face like ""keep your back straight"" or ""brace core"" but they won't tell you how to do that. For instance I saw a guy doing bench press with his trainer who was also the head trainer at that gym and that trainer didn't tell him to retract his scapula, performing bench press without retracting your scapula will fuck up your shoulders. The next day, that guy was complaining to his trainer that his right shoulder hurt for some reason and I told him exactly why they hurt. That's just one case, I have seen it happening so many times. I suggest you guys to do your own research and learn correct form to perform each exercise. Do NOT just add another exercise in your routine just because your trainer tells you to do it, pick 5-6 exercises and get better at them. Exercises like Deadlift, Squats, Pull Ups, Rows, OHP, Bench Press is all you need. Start with an empty barbell first and increase the weight by 2.5kg weekly. Search for Alan Thrall and Brian Alsruhe on YouTube to learn the correct form. Stay away from Smith Machine as much as you can, they will fuck up your joints. One of the trainers at my gym hurt his shoulder while doing Bench Press on Smith Machine.

cjtxxj,india,I was about to be falsely accused in a harassment case today but got saved thanks to some good samaritans.,"My apartment has a gym which can be used by the residents. Today I walked in a little early at around 6 PM. When I entered the gym, the first thing I heard was an older lady telling me to get out. I replied excuse me, as I was genuinely confused. To which she pointed at the door and said get out in a louder harsher tone. This really irked me and I confronted her and asked her to talk politely to which she said gym has ladies time from 4 PM to 7 PM. I told her there is no such rule written anywhere and asked her to show me proof. To this, she replied to go talk to the manager. I told her since it's her claim, she should show me proof to which she said don't argue, just get out. I told her even I can bring a couple of guys in the gym and tell you, people, that this is gents hour if I don't have proof, to which she shouted even more loudly saying don't talk back and asked me to get out. I just scoffed and proceeded to walk to my workout station where she physically stopped me and said something like such mannerless youth come here nowadays. I replied saying, I am just asking a question, which I have the right to and proceeded to my workout station by walking around her.

I think this hurt her ego, and she went and called the manager. When the manager came, she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically (her claim was I pushed her and went) and her aunty squad was backing her up. In fact, this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her. This is when I really wanted to whack her, but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor. Luckily, some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didn't do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying (which she was). When she knew she wasn't going to win this, she started demanding an apology from me, which I obviously refused. This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later. I think that's when the manager realized the lady was full of shit. He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules. I told him, if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule, I would have left. I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason. 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks. Just because they are old, they think they can get away with anything.

**Tl;dr: I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym.**



**Edit: Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that, to which I said that's fine. This rule was instated some 3 days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group (which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat). So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her. But she didn't want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions. I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesn't happen again. I also told him, the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive.**",[R]eddiquette,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/cjtxxj,1047,225,2019-07-31 00:11:00

dapcce,india,The tragic state of dentists in India,"Hi everyone,   
This is the first time I'm posting here. I've been a silent reader for many years.

I am here to highlight the tragic state of dentists and other medical professionals in India. The intention is not to rant, but to raise awareness so that the readers can share this perspective with their friends and family, some of whom may want to rethink their plans for a medical career staying in India. 

My friend is a dental (BDS) graduate from the best ranked dental college in the country. After 12th, he joined a good engineering college (Tier 2) because of the pressure he faced from his parents, but he was passionate about medicine and managed to get admitted into a BDS course after struggling for 1 year in engineering. He is currently a resident doctor at the hospital in his college and treats over 50 patients a day. I admire his stamina and dedication.

Since his fellowship ends in a few months, he was on the lookout for jobs in the private clinics (govt. clinics don't give jobs these days). After interviewing with some of the most well-known clinic chains, he came to me and shared his misery.   
**Private clinics offer Rs. 10000/-  a month for 10-12 hours work.** 

**Yes, you read that right. In some clinics, it goes upto Rs. 15,000/-. I was shocked to hear these figures. One can earn more by working as a cab-driver in any city.**   
In most countries, dentists are amongst the highest paid professionals. Yet, in India, they have to live on a poverty-level salary. My friend spends more than a few thousands every quarter to buy new tools because they need to be replaced to maintain hygiene standards. He has helped hundreds of patients, including critical cases, overcome their misery. People visit him from villages hundreds of kilometers away. And he gets offered 10000/- a month. **To put that into perspective, a dental clinic charges more than 5000 for a root canal treatment, which takes just 1 day of his time.** 

When we were discussing the reason for this, he said that the **Govts had opened up thousands of unregulated dental and medical colleges, and the graduates from these places don't get any clinical experience. Hence, many of them work for free at the clinics.** Most clinics don't distinguish between the quality and capability of the doctor- they just want someone with a degree and patient satisfaction is just not a concern**. He said that even MBBS graduates from state universities work for 20k a month in many places.** 

Hearing this, **I am actually sad that we keep saying that there aren't enough doctors, whereas the problem seems to be the total absence of regulation of the industry.** Now that the Govt is increasing the number of seats and allowing paramedics to work as clinicians, the problem will get worse. Already, many dentists work for free and I won't be surprised if in the future you might have to pay to work as a dentist in a clinic.   
 If anyone you know wants to pursue dentistry as a career, or even medicine, please let them know this side of the profession. Thank you.",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/dapcce,1030,348,2019-09-29 10:19:21

fqgtb9,india,This is how losing a war feels like,"I am a doctor. I am currently posted in the 2nd line of reinforcements waiting to be deployed when (not if) the front line falls. We have completed our retraining, attended numerous debriefs, attended workshops on quarantine for yourself and family and discharged most of our inpatients and our wards are converted into isolation wards. Our posting to virus wards has been chalked out and plans for our own quarantine set. Now we just sit and wait.

Currently the cases are being managed by internal medicine and pulmonologist as the front line and other hospitalist like us are waiting in reserves.  The wait is a nerve-wracking one. We know that the numbers by the government aren't accurate and the wave will come anytime anyday. We are constantly checking the dashboard for the new cases trying to predict when that might be. It's terrifying especially when we have stopped most of our daily/ routine work (only emergencies are working) and have all the time in the world to think and ponder. 

The lockdown that was implemented was a good idea but it's just delaying the inevitable. Stopping a virus with Ro 2.5 (approx) is like trying to stop wind, you can slow it down sure but not stop it. Hospitals are trying to get PPE (it's ok atm Atleast here) but when push comes to shove it will be like Stalingrad where conscripts were thrown in front of machine guns without rifles or ammunitions. Testing is also very inadequate similar to what a war time goverment does to keep the morale up by not reporting bad news (which I am sure isn't their intention here). Testing criterias are ridiculous and labs don't test unless you follow them to the letter (their hands are tied). Outbreak in this country most likely won't be like Italy or the US. We don't know how much worse this may get here. Given the population density god help us. 

We are starting to have desertion amongst our ranks. Some have tried and got certificates from other doctors stating to have pre-existing conditions and won't be able to work. In response the Administration has appointed medical boards to look at such cases and decide the risk accordingly.

I have never read any memoirs of someone in a losing side of the war. It would have really helped to know how they fought this hopelessness and gloom that has disrupted our lives. We are constantly hearing  horrific stories from American and Italian doctors in internet and it feels a window to our future in coming days or weeks. I can't talk about this with my parents. I have decided to keep them in dark about this as much as I can. They are constantly checking the numbers in my city and hospital. I think they also know what's coming.

I can only hope for general winter (Indian summer in this case) to stop this overwhelming force or a successful clinical trial that could atleast give us something to fight with.

P.S: 
1. I honestly believe that the government did the best they could, not only ours but across the world. This is just too hard of a foe to best.
2. Sorry if this is too pessimistic I am trying share the experiences of me and my colleagues some predictions about near future which I hope isn't correct.",Coronavirus,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fqgtb9,1021,104,2020-03-28 17:21:34

I have a dedicated server with GoDaddy that I use to host simple wordpress sites. One day I randomly decided to log into the server to check one of the sites and realized that I was unable to access the hosting. After sometime with tech support I was able to log in only to realize that my entire data was wiped clean. At first, the tech support tried to blame this to some ""hacking"" incident but when I kept asking for details such as the method of hacking, ip addresses used and other info, they reluctantly opened a support ticket. A day later they came back with a response saying that there was a problem with the server and they were moving the data which they lost somehow. They lost 25 sites that were hosted and didn't even offer an apology.

I called tech support again and they said that it was my fault for not keeping backups. When I asked for a refund for the hosting let alone the loss of data, the customer service representative asked me not to act ""smart"" as they are not responsible for anything.

&#x200B;

ed7hk8,india,Here are 20 points to prove how thickheaded we are...,"
1)They told us to make Aadhar Cards, which would be the singular identity for all citizens.
We obliged.

2)Then they told us to link our Aadhar Cards with our Banks, Pan and Mobiles... otherwise nothing would remain operational and also that everything would be more secure.
We did it.

3) Baba Ramdev started selling noodles, instead of teaching Yoga.
We ate it.

4) National Anthem had to be sung before a movie.
We sang along.

5) They told us that Rs.1000/= and Rs. 500/= notes would be demonitised. They advised us to exchange the old cash by standing in long queues day after day with a deadline threatening us. They said Black Money would be recovered/ uncovered.
We did it.

6)Then came Rs.2000/= notes.
Earlier the markets would grumble when we fished out our Rs. 1000/= or Rs.500/= notes and  wanted to change them.
Now we're doubly cursed, trying to change our Rs. 2000/=  notes.
We've accepted that too.

7) Then one midnight they started the GST.  Prices of goods went haywire.
We digested it.

8) They told us to give up the subsidy on Cooking Gas. 
Most of us did that too...except the top political leaders...!!!

9) The country's highest ' Statue of Unity ' was made with Rs.3000/= crores of the tax payer's money.
We watched it.

10) Two businessmen fled the country with thousands of crores.
We stood as silent spectators.

11) Cows blessed us with their dungs in front of our homes, inspite of the huge money spent  on
 ' Swatch Bharat ' program.
We put up with it.

12) Local trains couldn't be run on time, yet the bullet train was ushered in.
We were taken for a ride.

13) Since  BSNL has been sick for years, JIO entered the market, asking us to light the funeral pyre of BSNL.
We did it enthusiastically.

14) A top accused in the Sharada Scam became pure as lily, just by defecting..!!
We watched amused.

15) One accused of terrorism became an MP.
We voted.

16) Cow urine cost more than a bottle of mineral water.
We lapped it up.

17) A highly profitable PSU like BPCL  is about to be privatised.
We noted it.

18) Unemployment rate is highest in 45 years.
Still counting.

19) Onion costs more than Chicken.
Switched to vegetarian meat.

20) Let's go back to the first point...
They are again asking for documents to prove our citizenship...
We are left wondering 🤔🙄

fnfnh1,india,"There's something VERY FISHY going on with Covid-19 testing kits in India. Prima facie, it reeks of corruption & favoritism in a pandemic.","On 20th March, 18 firms got permission from govt. to get their testing kits validated by National Institute of Virology.

Meanwhile, a day earlier on 19th, Gujarat-based firm CoSara had already received an approval to start manufacturing Covid-19 test kits. This firm is a collaboration between a US-based company & an Ahmedabad-based firm.

CoSara's kits already have US FDA approval.

Some of the other 18 firms who were waiting to get their Covid-19 test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of 400-500 per kit (far cheaper than imported ones). 

CoSara, on the other hand, refused to publicly divulge the cost of their Covid-19 kits.

Suddenly, on 21st March, the Health Ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct Covid-19 tests. The cost of these is capped at a whopping 4500 rupees.

These guidelines have one caveat - ONLY testing kits approved by US FDA/European CE can be used.

That means ONLY kits manufactured by Ahmedabad-based CoSara can be used for Covid-19 testing.

So after allowing 18 firms to test their kits for production, the Modi govt. suddenly changed guidelines to favor ONLY 1 Ahmedabad company (whose testing kit cost is unknown).

Why is a Gujarat-based firm being provided a monopoly on Covid-19 testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight?

Why are 18 firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines? 

I've (Saket Gokhale) filed an RTI to get more info.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-test-kits-may-be-non-starter/articleshow/74765890.cms?from=mdr

Update: Now the health ministry in its press conference today has said, that US FDA and EU CE approval aren't mandatory. So, now Roche and CoSara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits. But the question remains why they haven't validated others as well. Either reject their application or accept it, why sit on it when test kits are badly needed.

**Highlights**

* *Background:* The past few months have been full of attacks on privacy. These include the government selling vehicle registration data, introducing facial recognition technology and increasing CCTV surveillance. Unfortunately, all this is being done in the absence of any safeguards, principal amongst them is a data protection bill.
* *IFF goes to Parliament:* Dr. Ravikumar (Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu), has introduced the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 today. This is a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code which puts the interests of Indian citizens first.

August is coming! And that makes it a full year since the consultations on India’s data privacy regime were held. More than two years after the epoch defining right to privacy judgement a data protection regime seems distant. Meanwhile, surveillance grows in scope, sophistication and creep.

Since the consultations in August, 2018 there has been little movement on the Personal Data Protection Bill. But there has been a lot of activity on projects which pose massive threats to privacy ([**read more on it here**](https://internetfreedom.in/running-out-of-time-but-never-out-of-slime-new-ways-in-which-your-data-is-threatened/))! We do not know if, and when the Government will table a bill for it, and what final form it will take. This is characteristic of a process that has lacked transparency even during the proceedings of the Justice Srikrishna Expert Committee ([**read more**](https://internetfreedom.in/untitled-2/)).

Today, Dr. Ravikumar, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, (read more on him [**here**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-constituency-then-state-nation/story-6ZrWdYrzqWouzvAVUERwlJ.html)) tabled the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019. This is a private member’s bill based off a reworked, updated, Indian Privacy Code, 2018 and the 7 Privacy Principles. The public comments received on it have been factored and changes have been made. We thank for the wide ranging participation by individuals and organisations in supporting it.

## Blueprint for a rights based data protection and surveillance reform law

There is very low chance that the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 will pass into a law, but it is one more small act of faith to protect the privacy of everyday, ordinary Indians. It will hopefully provide a useful basis, for study, inspire debate by our parliamentarians who are actively engaging on issues of data protection and surveillance reform. At the time of filing, it is the only legislative proposal on this issue.

Our engagement in this effort is a continuing attempt in a range of actions across institutions which have been documented at length at the SaveOurPrivacy.in campaign website. We have in the past worked with different members of parliament and will continue to do so to advance data protection and surveillance reform. We will also post analysis on this bill, and further upload it for further public debate and discussion.

We thank not only Dr. Ravikumar but all parliamentarians, notably Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Anupriya Patel, Asaduddin Owaisi, D. Ravikumar, Mahua Moitra, Manish Tewari, N.K. Premachandran, Supriya Sule, who are actively engaging on the issue of data protection. (wasn’t that a long list of names? These are just the MPs who have spoken in this present session of parliament on the need for a data protection law, showing how the issues cuts across party lines)

I am a Medical Researcher and moved back to India few days ago. I have a Master's degree in Pharmaceutical Sciences from Northeastern University, USA. I have worked in reputed research labs (both academia and industry) and  have a background in Drug delivery and molecular biology. I am well equipped to understand complex research topics and think critically. Since there aren't many well paying research jobs in India, I am very open to careers such as Scientific Writing/Publishing, Medical Affairs. However, I do not have experience in these jobs but I do have an aptitude to train myself. From what I figured from talking to Indian recruiters is that they are very specific in selecting candidates with a very specific experience. I am hoping recruiters to be little more flexible in their selection  process and base it on candidate's apptitude to pick up new things and grow in the role. It is thus very easy in the Western countries for people to expose themselves to different roles throughout their career and still keep it interesting.

bvv5df,india,today I told my maa about the childhood sexual molestation,"I am 30ish. I was molested when I was a kid, I was around 7-8 years old. I hadn't talked anyone about this. 

We used to stay in a small town (~10,000 population), in a joint family. My father's brother was the one who molested me. This was around summer holidays and whole ordeal went for about a month

today morning I told my mom about this. turns out she actually knew this :( she started sobbing and I couldnt stop myself either

when I was a kid, I had told her about this too. I don't remember this part. She fought with my father and the family. however she never told them about it. She just fought and split the joint family. And later we moved away. I remember some big fight happening at my home and we going away. However, I had no idea it was cos of my mom and she was doing it for me. My grand father passed away, shortly thereafter this. He didn't like the family to split.

everyone in the extended family hates her, cos she broke a joint family and is the reason of death of my grandpa. Our relatives don't invite her, just invite my dad to functions. 

today she told me all this. she had go through a lot cos of me. I know i am damaged, but today after learning my mom was there for me all along comforted me 

she told me she didn't know what to do. she had never heard anything like that and she didn't know she could approach police or authorities. (both my father and mother are uneducated). so she did what the best she could do, run away from there and taking me

I don't have anyone to talk to in real life, so I wanted to get this off my chest. sorry for the long post",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/bvv5df,895,91,2019-06-02 16:00:04

He provides historical context, brilliantly highlights our culture of brotherhood.

[Sadhguru's views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11RgVkZcPjY)

---

* Right at the beginning of the speech, Sadhguru admits that he hasn't read the act in its entirety. His views are based on what he read in the newspapers, and what ""is generally out there"". 

* Sadhguru repeats Amit Shah's lie that West Pakistan had 23% non-Muslims and 30% in Bangladesh. He claims that nobody has perfect numbers but these numbers can't be totally wrong. Expect, that they are: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-bangladesh-non-muslim-population-citizenship-amendment-bill-bjp-1627678-2019-12-12. A detailed analysis from Anand Ranganathan, now editor at Swarajya Magazine: https://www.newslaundry.com/2015/01/09/the-vanishing-hindus-of-pakistan-a-demographic-study-2?fbclid=IwAR1kKrkFa8Zj-X5sYDAU4mTbJDd8ERCkK6n38BcTGuu3-QEBFzzQnK8gq68

* He claims that minorities were persecuted during the 1971 war. While not false, this does paints a selective narrative. The genocide leading up to the 1971 war of Bangladeshi independence saw a large section of Muslims killed as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide

* Sadhuru claims that, unlike India, other (read Pakistan and Bangladesh) have religious discrimination built into their legal framework. This is demonstrably false in the case of Bangladesh as the [constitution of Bangladesh expressly forbids the state to discriminate on the basis of religion](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/bangladesh-constitution.pdf) [See Art. 28, 29 & 41]. Pakistan does have religious discrimination as only a Muslim can become the prime minister or the president, but Bangladesh does not have such limitations. 

* Sadhguru claims that Hindu marriages don't have legal recognition in Pakistan. This is no longer (since 2017) the case: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39233567. He even claims that he asked several people and they confirmed it (which is weird since the truth is but a google search away)

* Sadhguru falsely claims that India does not have blasphemy laws: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law#India (though to be fair to him, blasphemy is not punishable by death in India and the laws are used to harass people of all religions). 

* He claims that 3 million Bangladeshi Hindus were killed in the 1971 war. That's an iconic figure in Bangladeshi culture and is often questioned: https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/questioning-an-iconic-number/article5940833.ece. Regardless, the genocide (as I mentioned earlier), not only Hindus were killed. There Pakistani Army was brutal against Bangladeshi Muslims demanding independence as well. Bihari Muslims were also persecuted by the Bengalis, their woes are often forgotten. 

* He claims that Assam has been overrun by refugees, and the refugee population in Assam is bigger than the local population. This is staggeringly false as even the Assam NRC which has been criticised as draconian could only find 19 lakh people who came to Assam after 1971 (from a population of 3.2 crore). 

* He claims that people are protesting because they don't want to give refugee to anyone. While this may be the case in Assam, the majority of the country is protesting because we believe that the CAA is discriminatory in nature as it introduces a religious filter for acquiring Indian citizenship. 

* Sadhguru then claims that CAA only gives citizenship to those facing religious persecution. This is again false, as CAA simply assumes that anyone who is Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist or Parsi has faced religious persecution. The phrase ""religious persecution"" is not even present in the act. 

* Sadhguru excuses the police violence by claiming that when a few thousand protestors corner 25 policeman and thrash them, it is only natural that these protestors will face the consequences of their actions when a bigger police force arrives. He further justifies the police action by claiming that even if not all the protestors were throwing stones, it is only natural that everyone of them will be beaten up if there were incidents of stone throwing. 

* He commends the police for showing restrain and not resorting to firepower. We know that was not the case.  [Video suggesting shots were fired](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/3-days-after-jamia-violence-delhi-police-investigate-shooting-videos-2150987) | [Protestors with bullet injuries](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jamia-clashes-two-protesters-admitted-to-delhi-hospital-with-bullet-injuries-says-official-2149762)

* Refers to those protesting as ""illiterate masses of religious groups"". 

* He claims that people have been misinformed as the CAA does not take away people's citizenship. He completely omits the fact that people are protesting because of a genuine fear that combined with NRC, CAA will be discriminatory towards Indian Muslims. We see that this will already be the case in Assam, where out of the 19 lakh that were left out of NRC, the non-Muslims will be eligible for citizenship while the Muslims will not be. 

* He parrots a list of documents that will be enough to prove your citizenship while ignoring the fact that the document with the most widespread reach in the country - aadhar - is not a proof of citizenship. See: https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/dec/21/aadhaar-voter-id-card-passport-not-proof-of-citizenship-government-officials-2079070.html

The fundamental problems with the CAA (and NRC) are as follows ([courtesy: Student Bar Association, NLSIU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMPdXi1KXbpRei1WRcdpDpOgsBjpzsif/view))

* **What is it?** Allows for immigrants from certain communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to acquire citizenship. 

* **Evident Problems** Muslims are excluded from acquiring citizenship solely on the basis of religion. Furthermore, definition of illegal migrants restricted to only three countries, this excluding other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, etc.

* **Why is this problematic?** Our Constitution envisages India to be a secular state. This means that no distinction can be made between persons solely on the basis of religion. Hence, excluding Muslims expressly violates the secular nature of our Constitution.

* **Regional Restrictions** There is no rational basis for restricting the countries from which inflow is allowed to Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Afghanistan. The amendment allegedly aims to protect persecuted minorities. Then what about the Tamils from Sri Lanka, the Rohingyas from Myanmar, the Nepali Gorkhas and the Uighurs and Ahmadiyas facing persecution? The amendment does not consider this.

* **What about the NRC?** The National Register of Citizens, first implemented in Assam, required a person to produce documents of her
ancestry in order to be eligible for citizenship. This falls hard on even legitimate citizens due to lack of necessary documents. Therefore even citizens can get excluded under the NRC, like in Assam, where over 19 lakh applicants were excluded from the final list.

* **NRC & CAA - a double threat?** Now, if an Indian citizen gets excluded under the NRC, and if she is a non- Muslim, she can claim citizenship under the CAA. However, if she happens to be a Muslim, then CAA ensures that she will not be granted citizenship as a naturalised migrant.

**Sadhguru fails to address even a single criticism of the act, while painting the protestors as people with no shred of sympathy for those fleeing religious persecution.**",Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/ehjsxb,877,149,2019-12-30 17:10:00

epe5rj,india,Thoughts about India after visiting Vietnam.,"I went to Vietnam on a holiday recently. We selected Vietnam because we were fascinated by its growth and also we were deeply saddened by the devastation that the Vietnam war have unleashed on the country. Vietnam remains the largest chemical weapons deployment site till date. US dropped more bombs in vietnam than it did in world war 2. Yet the country is booming. 

We were surprised to see cities with very good education decent health and lots of jobs for the population. An English-speaking tourist guide in Vietnam without a degreee earns more than 30,000 rupees a month. A decent restaurant meal costs less than 300 rupees with all sorts of seafood included. Even in the remotest villages we found good schools with playgrounds. Small factories producing handicraft, garments and small electronic devices are throughout the countryside. 

The most important feeling was that of Hope. Vietnamese people want progress and want to be leader in manufacturing and later innovation.  

My parents said that they were sad that India was a much better country during the time they grew up. There was hope and there was a feeling of pride in how we were using the little resources in the puursuit for our national development. Today the narrative in India is centered on religion caste and other useless nonsensical factors. How are you going to get jobs because there aren't many factories which are exporting goods to the developed countries. We import even edible oil and onions. 

I have a deep fear that India will not even manage to become like Vietnam in the next 50 years. In Vietnam there was a Subway being constructed. The entire area was covered to prevent dust from coming out and the roads were pretty decent. We traveled over 700 kilometers in the countryside and did not witness more than 3 to 4 kaccha houses. You may blame communism for destroying the world but it seems that some socialistic aspects are necessary to create a thriving economy, like education and and decent infrastructure. 

We spent less than 30,000 INR per person and got to experience luxury hotels, great sea food and amazing nature. We spent the same amount in Goa in 2013 and got to live in budget rooms, eat stale sea food and go on overhyped tours that were crowded and chaotic. 

My parents also agree that it doesn't make sense to Holiday in India anymore because you can get a better experience in countries like Malaysia Indonesia Vietnam or Thailand.


 If us common people are thinking like this imagine how investors are thinking. India is not an investment destination because we do not have the resources to create the infrastructure and culture of hospitality that other countries offer. Foreigners have to register at some police station or foreign office and pay double or triple the price for entering a tourist destination. 

Tourism is the second largest employer globally. This experience taught us that India gets less than 10 million tourists and Vietnam gets more than 15 million tourists for a reason. India is being disrespectful of what the world is really thinking about us.  We think we were great 5000 years ago so we are great today. That is false. India is going into a downward spiral of chaos.",Non-Political,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/epe5rj,860,313,2020-01-16 12:19:47

The ads are made in a way, it looks like that condoms are sex enhancers. They give more pleasure. Where the opposite is true. Also that's not the purpose of the condom anyway.

Condoms are not sexy. Condom ads should not be sexy either. It should contain an old white haired wise looking doctor (to get the attention of the parents) where he tells the actual job of the condom and why it is important. We don't need Sunny Leone twerking on the beach with a strawberry in her hands.

e1yy9u,india,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?","After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/e1yy9u,828,125,2019-11-26 22:51:44

ecjv68,india,"Remember this, India, that the people of Hong Kong have been protesting for more than six months(!) now. It doesn't matter that Section 144 was imposed. What matters is letting your voice be heard and your protest acknowledged.","There have already been some great posts on what to do and what not to do in this situation, and as a bit of moral support, I just want to give you an example of ongoing protests in another part of the world.

As most of you may have known/heard, some events that significantly tear the fabric of relations between Hong Kong SAR and mainland China led to huge protests. Even though Hong Kong is not a true democracy, and in spite of police violence and abuse, the people of Hong Kong have not stopped protesting against Carrie Lam and the Chinese government.

And this is just one city. India is huge! As Indians, the impact we can make is more than significant.

I want to especially call out to the youngsters and youth. The old coots who are running the show at the moment are not the ones who will live to see the reality they are creating. The entire brunt will be on our shoulders as we grow up/grow old.

It is high time that we stop listening to the old ""trust your elders, obey your elders, be servile to your elders"" bullshit, because trust me, it doesn't matter on what side of the spectrum you are. Your ""elders"" only care about their own ideals and you have no value other than how you can serve them until they grow too old to live.

 If we don't fight to ideate an India that we want to live in, nobody else will. Will you suffer a few beatings, a night or a few in jail if it can mean that this draconian law is repealed? Remember that our freedom fighters endured much, much worse. They literally participated in jail bharo andolans and there were times when the number of freedom fighters in jail exceeded the numbers that the government rounded up in Kashmir.

If you are undecided, remember that there are thousands more like you out there. There is strength in numbers. It is entirely your choice.",Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/ecjv68,831,25,2019-12-19 06:36:41

e6sx1g,india,Surprised by how many people in my social circle are happy with encounter of the rape accused! Welcome to India.,"The number of people in my whatsapp groups and other social circles who are happy with this encounter is just mind numbing. This is simply extra judicial killings, no proper investigation done. It's not yet established whether they were actually the culprits. The accused were killed while they were taken for evidence collection. The recent movie Article 15 portrayed such events pretty vividly. 

It is ridiculous how people can't think rationally. Appalling. These are people I know and are generally sane. I think common man doesn't have the ability to think beyond superficial logic. And if you let mob justice prevail, then you will be happy until you yourself are crucified. But then again, what do you expect in a society where elected representatives call for mob lynching of the accused. This speaks more to our distrust in the proper rule of law in our country than anything else.

Sorry for the rant, but it is just so overwhelming that I can't ignore it. When I try to put this alternate view point, people accuse you of sympathizing with the rapists, which is clearly not what I am trying to do.

cml5qs,india,"To everyone so loudly celebrating today, ask yourselves a few basic questions.","1. What strange idea of a unified nation are you celebrating when the decisions (some of which are yet to be formalized into effect) to alter an entire state's present and future were taken without its citizens' consent or even knowledge, amid a total blackout of communication services and lockdown on personal movement, so that the state's own people had no idea (and many might still not) what was going on until after the rest of the world? If this ever happens to you, I'd like to know how celebratory you feel.

2. What bold move are you celebrating when the only way this could have been done was in total secrecy and by silencing any voice of dissent from the state, by placing leaders under arbitrary house arrest? What courage does it take to silence and subjugate everyone and then make your move unimpeded?   

3. What historic step are you celebrating – the one that has set such a dangerous precedent for Constitutional principles and democracy, the one that has trampled all over human rights?

4. What is this #KashmirHamaraHai that you are shouting about? Is Kashmir just a piece of land to you, one to be annexed and forced into submission by trickery and without the consent or knowledge of the people who actually live on that land? Are you honestly just so excited about buying that retirement home in Sonamarg or Pahalgam that you've forgotten basic humanity?

5. What development opportunities are you so looking forward to – the arbitrary use of UAPA to arrest any protestor on charges of terrorism?

6. What firm message against terrorism are you celebrating - do you not see that this is smoke and mirrors to distract from the fact that the economy is doing so poorly?

7. Even if you genuinely believe that 370 and 35A need to go and that bifurcation is somehow going to be useful, is there any need to be so ridiculously insensitive to the absolute fear and panic within which all of this is unfolding, the fact that people have been unable to speak with their parents, unable to find out if they are even alive? You might argue the end justifies the means – that is, if you're even thinking about the means at all. But the next time something like this happens – and make no mistake, there will be a next time, and it won't always be in far-flung Assam or Kashmir that don't directly affect you or your family – think about how you reacted today.

Edit: This is a post from Facebook. I am not the one who wrote this. I shared it here because I found it raised some important questions, and we should put ourselves into their skin before taking sides. Or if there are indeed times when you can't take a side, then this is probably one of those for me.
