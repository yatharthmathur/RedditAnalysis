Most of my friends married without revealing their struggles I am talking about both male and female friends from big cities and towns as well

Obviously I dont know where they will be five or ten years from now But as of now things seem to be going well

Obviously I dont really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives

The mental struggles do manifest although and could be kept hidden for only so long

I believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines As they can cause sexual dysfunction  erectile dysfunction

So this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple 

Other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic So the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities But it could be really positive too as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well

I myself have lived a life of honesty so I never hide Although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness And they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness

So it tends to become a conflict of interest

So some people decide to keep things to themselves because others might exaggerate for fun And it might lead to them being Ostracized 

I personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although I want to conform with the social norms to some degree And there always is interest of family members as well 


I am not looking for advice more of a discussion

 Innovations across the Country

 TripleLayered Antiinfectious Gloves 

About  of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triplelayered gloves that are antiinfectious The gloves not only protect the users hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves These gloves once opened can be used for a maximum period of three days The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon

 Antibacterial Clothing

fz16t8,india,Policy/Economy,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fz16t8,1,21,2020-04-11 17:32:32,"Overpopulation  how I would go about trying to fix it By  we are projected to add a further mn more to our current bn to reach a total of bn Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of incomewealth inequality as were seeing played out in the Coivd crisis This problem is not limited to India alone as all of South Asia has goneis going through the same boom putting further pressure on limited resources in the region 

Political parties dont want to touch this issue and for good reason  India has a dark past with population control The Indian state further cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past one child policy In any event I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies whether that means having  children or no children 

In my view whats required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who dont have children in addition to current policies encouraging contraception Participation will be totally voluntary The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless

 Government issues bonds that mature in  years It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists BITCH At maturity this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at  Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents the bond will The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services 

 Alternatively government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity

 In lieu of cash paymentsbond issues government could award agricultural land to childless persons The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees

 Medalscertificatesgovernment mandated public approval I personally dont care for this but most people do In any event Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion

 Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier I think this could work but is also very open to abuse people adopting orphans for payoutschild abuse already prevalent in adopted children so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control 

 Schooluniversity education geared towards encouraging childlessness Its clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently but even at peak efficiency resources will be consumed The best way to reduce ones environmental impact would be to not have children

I want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary  there is no hint of coercion However in order to ensure participants remain childless there will likely a degree of enforcement required For instance participants will have to undergo vasectomiestubal ligations Naturally government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants Having said that government already has full knowledge of parentschildren through its Aadhar database Further all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery

 The community transmission of coronavirus has apparently started in Mumbai and its adjoining localities as the fresh positive cases emerging from there are neither immediate contacts of patients nor have any travel history

 The D ward which has Byculla in its limits has got the secondhighest number of cases Localities such as Dharavi Kurla Nehru Nagar Bandra and Andheri too have a significant number of positive cases

 We are more worried and concerned about the health workers and doctors who have been tested coronavirus positive In Mumbai more than  people from the medical fraternity are detected as viruspositive The community spreading has therefore started as we see a surge in a number of cases from various parts of the city They have neither international travel history nor immediate contact We are declaring these areas as contaminated cluster and subsequently sealing them sais senior BMC officer

Please help me  If any one here is a psychiatrist or in this field  please advise me on what to do 


It started a few days ago  I was fine and doing well Until I watched a movie about someone being falsely accused  I got intrusive thoughts that I might get falsely accused too  and my fear was escalated when I realised that I have a pretty suspicious post history on reddit and search history too  so I got really scared that Id be falsely accused  so I did a few Google searches about weather or not im being tracked by the government or not  and it came with scary search results so my intrusive thoughts shifted to being spied on and falsely accused at the same time  now I dont have a lot of friends but I really value the few friends I have so I was scared that this would hurt my reputation and I would lose my current friends and not be able to make new friends either  then later on I got so anxious and thought what if I am actually a criminal  The idea didnt bother me at first but then I googled surpressed memories and I got pretty scared as well  and had the thought that I might be actually a horrible criminal and have surpressed memories of it because I cant remember doing anything bad  I had additional intrusive thoughts as well like this world being a hallucination and that maybe in reality Im doing some terrible things  I was extremely scared and had a lot of anxiety  Then later on it shifted to my current fear  That is going to   This fear is based on a dream I had a few months ago I had a dream that my life would crumble down And that Id be rejected by everyone and that Id never reach my loved ones  I was really going through panic in my dream  And was contemplating suicide or drugs too  There was a figure in that dream that resembled ryuk from the anime death note  Who was mocking me about my fateRight now I feel similar to that dream  But I have reasons to believe that this might be true Because Ive been noticing various signs like scary typos while typing and ads with specific wordings etc and events like me bringing a new charger and it not working afterwords  And me having to lay down in a specific position so it charges while using it  Having to eat bad food etc and My mom acting weird I saw two other anime called hell girl and Babylon which scared me too  Because both plots resemble what Im going through Im really anxious at this point and dont know what to do  Im scared and always have a feeling like Im being watched  I even thought to myself that if I wear this specific clothing then something scary would happen and well  I saw the hell girl cast and had a hallucination of making a deal with the devil  or taking a loan from a hell bank now Im scared of going to a bank or taking out a loan I was interested in anime and now Im scared of it  I was interested in banking stuff and now Im scared  Even now Im witnessing scary typos too  I dont know what to do One reason Im scared of getting help is because  I think that if I let my guard down or feel relieved  Something terrible would happen  And in Babylon  Help from nowhere worked for the protagonist almost  This seems similar to me  and Im scared of it and hope its not  


Even now Im witnessing scary signs like word suggestions  scary co incidences  someone with the username naively idealistic messaged me with kind words  This seemed like a supernatural warning  One thing I forgot to mention is that a main character in hell girl three vessels saw her ambitions crumble and her succeeding the hellgirl  I dont want this to happen with me 

Fuck Im even having scary medical symptoms  and disturbing  typos and  signs as if telling me to not Talk about this   This all seems so scary and frightening  Im really scared please help me

Edit  it seems to keep on getting scarier 


Edit  Im scared of feeling even slightly relieved or talking about this because im scared of its  repucussions if any its really frightening 

Edit  I felt a strong earthquake that seems like only I felt  idk what this was  Now Im really scared even more 

Edit  just remembered that there was another character in hellgirl who was accused of something and sent to hell  dont know if falsely or not  Now Im even more scared

Edit  since I seem to be more concerned about being accused And at times Im not much anxious Im really scared Fuck  I am more scared about being accused  I dont know  What If I appeared like a manipulator or appeared normal to a psychiatrist  

Edit  what if Im looking like one right now  Please  Im suffering  Im not lying about being anxious 

Edit  more scary signs and scary thoughts  For example Im going and Im goin was in a text bar  And my phone discharged too  And some scary  warning etc  kind of typos  Even when typing now  oof more typos and non typos in some sentences  even now scary signs

Edit  The earthquake was in Delhi  my area 
 The epicenter too  Which is scary  Inmany ways

Edit  many of the themes in that anime seem really scary and similar  Like regret etc and people sending others to hell but realising their mistakes since they go to hell too  By doing so And other situations leading to them regretting their decisions  Im getting so many scary typos and signs while typing this 

Edit  I had  a dream when I was sleeping recently about being a big criminal on the run  And I had a dream about reading about hellgirl on Wikipedia and how disturbing it is and Hell is  I had a negative dream again wearing the same sheet  That I wore when I had my previous negative dreams  Its so frightening  And I had so many scary typos typing this Edit of this edit  the typos were really scary like warnings even now I think 


Edit  Im still seeing scary signs etc  For example a sinister smile shape in a cup of tea etc  Im really scared  Im scared that maybe   innocent people can be sent to hell too  

Edit  I saw something related to the thing I think I should have avoided  Related to banking kind of  And Im scared I made the wrong decision by doing so maybe  Even my phone discharged before  For many minutes  Im  scared that maybe this is a pattern or symbolic or manipulated 

Edit  still witnessing scary signs

Edit  the second previous edit is scaring me  Im scared that maybe I shouldnt have seen stuff related to banking  Because it seems so symbolic and patterned

Edit  I remember being really jelous of my cousin  And hating him  In hell girl you can send people to hell like i said  I dont want to be in that situation  I have an ambition that Im afraid of having crumbled  Im unable to put it in words right now and thats what scares me because of the repucutions if any  Of it  Im having negative thoughts of my close people betraying me  Or looking like they betrayed me or crumbling my ambition  And i doing something terrible like sending them to hell  And going to hell as well  Im seriously scared  

Edit  I even had scary medical symptoms again 
 

Edit  Im sorry to everyone who Ive wished hell and anything bad on  Im sorry  

Edit  I tried to copy paste this to  cups forums but it didnt work I wonder what it could mean 

Edit  I saw some things 
 That Im scared of there  Now Im scared  I dont even wanna talk about it but Im scared that this means something and might have repucutions 

Edit  Im scared almost everytime and scared that Im being watched supernaturally

I had a colleague who was  bit obsessed with his work He would stay late hours in office to work This all was fine until he was single He got married last year Even for wedding he took leave of only five days Even after marriage his staying late at office continued His wife being alone at home all days thoughts started creeping into her mind that he might be having some affair in office She got female colleagues number somehow called her and asked her questions such as Is there a really too much work at office  who all stay late at office Like that 
Within six months of marriage she filed for divorce Now this guy he went into depression and started being late to the officehe wouldnt complete his work on time cause he was always distracted He started receiving flak for it in the office He became more n more depressed He had accident few months back I dont know but maybe because he was distracted while driving   
Today he was let go because of poor performance 

Devoting yourself to the work is good But be aware there is life outside of the work There is your family who loves you Do not neglect them for work Because if it comes to it your employer will replace you within  monthsnotice period 

Thats all I have to say Thank you for reading

If you havent been following here is what happened

 The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 
 The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA made up of BJP and Shiv Sena and the UPA made up of NCP and Congress
 BJP lost  seats and Shiv Sena lost  while Congress gained  seats and the NCP gained 
 BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 
 After the results were declared the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for  years was not met
 The governor a member of the BJP and RSS btw from the th to the th of November invited the BJP then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority
 After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority Presidents Rule was imposed on th November
 Meanwhile the Congress NCP and the Shiv Sena which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress  entered into an alliance together to form the government
 Before they could form the government though Ajit Pawar nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative broke away from the NCP along with a few rebel MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government
 On  November at  AM the governor revoked Presidents rule and accepted the formation of the BJPAjit PAwar government administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis who became the CM and entered his second term  and Ajit Pawar who became Deputy CM Suspiciously around this same time all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped
 The Congress NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions
 The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today
 Today unable to prove majority Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved

What is happening as of  IST and will happen

 The Congress NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM
 MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM
 Ajit Pawar and the rebel MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM edit its still left to be seen what Ajit Pawars fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started
 The terms of the power sharing AFAIK are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for  years each with the Congress will play a supporting role with all three parties sharing equal power

Edit What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events but I cant help but feel that all events after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaperwearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to

 Split the SenaBJP alliance Although the alliance was always rocky Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals
 Prevent BJP from forming the government Now this seems super obvious but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election
 Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals It was one of the major reasons why they won in  Now after the saga with Ajit Pawar who lets face it was never seriously splitting with the NCP and all this was just a ploy Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner
 Saved Ajit Pawar from jail This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverertool of salvation

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar NCP Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga

 DEMOCRACY IS DEAD Im sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped betrayed and angry rn and they have a very good reason to be If ultimately the choice of a population does not even matter what point is there to Democracy What point is there to voting Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly  Sharad Pawar Uddhav Thackeray Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat
 INTEGRITY IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DONT MATTER All that matters now is power Yeah the Congress NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance Why even have separate parties then 
 VOTERS DONT MATTER All  parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India

Edit We still cant say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed he is know to make rash decisions Sharad Pawar He wasnt present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap So its still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not it has only helped the NCPShiv SenaCongress alliance",1310

I posted this last week on my Facebook and wanted to share here with our friends from the other side Perhaps we can see some commonality  I hope this gets posted 



The night of Shabaan has never been an ordinary night for a Muslim teenager For some of us in Karachi it is almost like Eid  new clothes cakes and presents For others it is about food and sweetmeats For almost everyone it is about prayers and astaghfaar For me however it was about firecrackers and patakhay for many many years

Growing up in Karachi Shab e Barat was one of those few traditions that continued to connect us with the longing of AJTFS throughout the year despite it just being a oneday event It is celebrated every year on the night of th of Shabaan neema Shabaan  Middle of Shabaan with much fanfare prayer and nazars For me what started with firecrackers and food during my teenage years turned into a deeply spiritual practice over the years It is customary among many Muslims to pen a letter of love and dedication to ImameZamana as during the night of the th This letter is called Areeza meaning Request

As kids we loved writing and submitting an Areeza I cant be sure about how Areezas are submitted elsewhere In my family in Karachi wed get a few blank Areezas from the mosque and then complete them using a qalam  a type of pen made from a cut dried reed used for Islamic calligraphy The qalam would be dipped in an ink made from saffron and itr non alcoholic scent and then wed write our requests dreams aspirations and profess our love for the Imam e Waqt It would be an intensely personal moment and an opportunity to share our inner most desires and fears Once completed these could be delivered to any tributary  a river lake or the sea I always felt the longing and the belief took precedence over the process and the tools so Ive tried to write Areezas throughout the year instead of just Shabaan

 years ago growing up in Nazimabad we had only a few options We could either go to our local mosque Noor Ul Emaan where theyd have paper Areezas for us to submit And then the mosque volunteers would deliver these completed Areezas to Naity Jaity Natives Jetty The second option was to write an Areeza at home and then go to Naity Jaity ourselves Now this second option was much fascinating for the youth as it likely involved a road trip

I have to admit during my teenage years my fascination for the day and what followed was more superfluous than spiritual I remember the day starting with fasting and helping my mother with groceries There would be an elaborate nazar later in the day so we all looked forward to the kabab halva and the puriz Wed make portions of the nazar and take to the graveyard After offering Fateha for the grandparents and other relatives wed distribute the nazar amongst the custodians Back at home we would break our fasts and perform amaal for the day The lucky ones got to sneak out and celebrate with firecrackers and patakhay

In our particular home we had a mix of Lucknow and Karachi traditions After the evening Nazar wed start our amaal and stay up for the whole night After midnight we complete the amaal and start writing our Areezas My mother would make dough balls for us to bury our Areezas in I remember she telling me the reason why we use dough balls was because the fish from the Naity Jaity would carry the Areezas off to AJTFS The place used to be packed  people from all walks of life vendors and small groups from all over Everyone converging on this auspicious night to share their deepest desires aspirations and fears with the Imam e Waqt as It would be a surreal moment to reckon with In my family we were always to spend the night in Ibadaat rather than being swept in the culture of firecrackers that seemed to have taken root I remember stopping on our way back at Saabri Nihari Saddar and having Nihari early morning just as crimson would start to engulf the horizon

There is much debate today about the necessity of faith and religion No matter which lens you view Shab e Baraat through it is a testament that ones belief is at the core of our individual survival All of us many of us while we may speak different languages follow different religions we are almost always expressing the same faith in a power beyond us

And whether we believe in this or not we acknowledge deep down that there are things beyond your control

And that is what binds us all together EidMubarak

We used to stay in a small town  population in a joint family My fathers brother was the one who molested me This was around summer holidays and whole ordeal went for about a month

today morning I told my mom about this turns out she actually knew this  she started sobbing and I couldnt stop myself either

when I was a kid I had told her about this too I dont remember this part She fought with my father and the family however she never told them about it She just fought and split the joint family And later we moved away I remember some big fight happening at my home and we going away However I had no idea it was cos of my mom and she was doing it for me My grand father passed away shortly thereafter this He didnt like the family to split

everyone in the extended family hates her cos she broke a joint family and is the reason of death of my grandpa Our relatives dont invite her just invite my dad to functions 

today she told me all this she had go through a lot cos of me I know i am damaged but today after learning my mom was there for me all along comforted me 

she told me she didnt know what to do she had never heard anything like that and she didnt know she could approach police or authorities both my father and mother are uneducated so she did what the best she could do run away from there and taking me

I dont have anyone to talk to in real life so I wanted to get this off my chest sorry for the long post",321

I think this hurt her ego and she went and called the manager When the manager came she told him I was rude to her and was harassing her physically her claim was I pushed her and went and her aunty squad was backing her up In fact this woman had grabbed my hand and tried to physically stop me from entering and now was accusing me of me abusing her verbally and pushing her This is when I really wanted to whack her but knowing how the law works it would have gone to her favor Luckily some other women in the gym stood up for me and said I didnt do anything but ask her for proof of the rule to which the aunty replied something akin to us accusing her of lying which she was When she knew she wasnt going to win this she started demanding an apology from me which I obviously refused This is when she abused me some more and said something on the lines of aaj kal ke ye bacche and left while threatening me she will handle me later I think thats when the manager realized the lady was full of shit He then calmly explained to me about the new gym timing rules I told him if she would have politely asked me to leave and shown me the new rule I would have left I just confronted her because she was extremely rude to me for no reason 

Dunno where this entitlement comes from in these old fucks Just because they are old they think they can get away with anything

Tldr I was accused of verbal and physical abuse by some old aunty because I asked her a question and got saved by some women in my gym



Edit Manager took the blame in the end and apologized for that to which I said thats fine This rule was instated some  days ago and was apparently sent to everyone in the building Whatsapp group which I am not a part of since my brother owns the flat So the lady had a physical copy of the rule on her But she didnt want to show it to me because elders should be listened to without any questions I told the manager to please post it on the door or something so something like this doesnt happen again I also told him the only reason I got irked was that the lady was being really rude and downright abusive",676

 Tldr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India  This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications

We devote substantial space to a frontend analysis of three contact applications Singapores TraceTogether MITs Private Kit  Safe Paths Project and Aarogya Setu We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing  To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Courts developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy Over this week we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time Its possible if we try

 Reframing the Privacy and Public Health tradeoff

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pickme up videos from celebrities and influencers A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid pandemic In these extraordinary times it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends family and colleagues in person

However there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness At the same time technology based solutions in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India

Recognising the digital nature of our society we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid This must be done in a rights respecting manner and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward

 Overview of the working paper

This working paperhttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentdnDoPzygQyTetEguOlzulaOyffYJDsAPdOUedituspsharing is a comprehensive effort spanning  pages and  sections The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy Starting with the collection use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions which we premise is based on growing trust This can be achieved by respecting a persons autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions the paper builds out a frontend analysis of three contact applications Singapores TraceTogether MITs Private Kit  Safe Paths Project and Aarogya Setu Pages  in Section  We also look at the AppleGoogle partnership and the promise that it holds but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from transnational silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny

Finally we end with an appeal to policymakers stating Adapting a silicon valley adage if we move fast we may just break more than things  possibly even democracy itself It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid pandemic

 We have three primary objectives from this working paper

A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday This is to document analyse and then later pose solutions We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India

Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy

Collaborative solutions for government We dont have all the answers But maybe if we work together some credible suggestions can be made to the government Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on Google DocshttpsdocsgooglecomdocumentdnDoPzygQyTetEguOlzulaOyffYJDsAPdOUedituspsharing with the functionality for comment and review In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the Internet Freedom Forumhttpsforuminternetfreedomin

 What does IFF plan to do with this working paper

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller digestible pieces So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government technologists academics and experts

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health

httpspreviewredditqnbxjcncpngwidthformatpngautowebpsbabdeddefabdc

Highlights

 Background The past few months have been full of attacks on privacy These include the government selling vehicle registration data introducing facial recognition technology and increasing CCTV surveillance Unfortunately all this is being done in the absence of any safeguards principal amongst them is a data protection bill
 IFF goes to Parliament Dr Ravikumar Lok Sabha MP from Tamil Nadu has introduced the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill  today This is a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code which puts the interests of Indian citizens first

 Parliament gets a modern progressive legislative proposal

August is coming And that makes it a full year since the consultations on Indias data privacy regime were held More than two years after the epoch defining right to privacy judgement a data protection regime seems distant Meanwhile surveillance grows in scope sophistication and creep

Since the consultations in August  there has been little movement on the Personal Data Protection Bill But there has been a lot of activity on projects which pose massive threats to privacy read more on it herehttpsinternetfreedominrunningoutoftimebutneveroutofslimenewwaysinwhichyourdataisthreatened We do not know if and when the Government will table a bill for it and what final form it will take This is characteristic of a process that has lacked transparency even during the proceedings of the Justice Srikrishna Expert Committee read morehttpsinternetfreedominuntitled

Today Dr Ravikumar Member of Parliament Lok Sabha read more on him herehttpswwwhindustantimescomindianewsfirstconstituencythenstatenationstoryZrWdYrzqWouzvAVUERwlJhtml tabled the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill  This is a private members bill based off a reworked updated Indian Privacy Code  and the  Privacy Principles The public comments received on it have been factored and changes have been made We thank for the wide ranging participation by individuals and organisations in supporting it

 Blueprint for a rights based data protection and surveillance reform law

There is very low chance that the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill  will pass into a law but it is one more small act of faith to protect the privacy of everyday ordinary Indians It will hopefully provide a useful basis for study inspire debate by our parliamentarians who are actively engaging on issues of data protection and surveillance reform At the time of filing it is the only legislative proposal on this issue

Our engagement in this effort is a continuing attempt in a range of actions across institutions which have been documented at length at the SaveOurPrivacyin campaign website We have in the past worked with different members of parliament and will continue to do so to advance data protection and surveillance reform We will also post analysis on this bill and further upload it for further public debate and discussion

We thank not only Dr Ravikumar but all parliamentarians notably Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury Anupriya Patel Asaduddin Owaisi D Ravikumar Mahua Moitra Manish Tewari NK Premachandran Supriya Sule who are actively engaging on the issue of data protection wasnt that a long list of names These are just the MPs who have spoken in this present session of parliament on the need for a data protection law showing how the issues cuts across party lines

fzfkko,india,Policy/Economy,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/fzfkko,7,1,2020-04-12 03:25:10,"Lives  livelihoods in India Lives and livelihoods

Context

The Prime Minister while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods He rightly privileged the former over the latter then As India nears the end of the lockdown period the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front  

Issues

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown
Way ahead

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread 
The lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for  of GDP India should spend at least  of GDP for now  about lakh crore 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least  a month for the next three months This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas as was announced earlier
Outofthebox ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend what the developed countries are doing
In the harvest season farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets
Lenders including NBFCs should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent 
A credit guarantee fund that will support nondelinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months at least for MSMEs 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option
The loss of revenue will be lakh crore at worst but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track 


Conclusion

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative Generous support from the government and quickly delivered is the need of the hour",456

 The women in the gang wouldve already filed for sexual harassment profanity and indecent behaviour even before the heist

 Moscow in his death bed wouldve revealed Monika was Denvers step sister 

 Professor starts taking class The bitch Tokyo will already be messing since she hates Berlin and isnt in charge of the heist Rio is terribly in love that he never listens to any class or keeps bunking classes and blindly listens to anything Tokyo says  Tokyo plans a riot against professor and Berlin The plan is ruined 

 The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation

 Dont even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth everyone would demand a privacy 

 Everyone even after the th day would still have the perfect hair makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps abs  chest etc 

 Also there would be atleast a  dream sequence songs

 Boman Irani would play Arturo Roman 

 Their hideout during the  month training period would be in LehLadakh or Darjeeling 

 Dali masks to replaced by that of BigB or Sachin Tendulkar

 And all this Smoking Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers

 After the success of Season  The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace TokyoNairobi in the subsequent seasons
Role of Stockholm would be reserved for a newcomer  Probably a Star KidAnanya Pandey or Jhanvi Kapoor Coz you need to reserve one for Nepotism

 Modiji wouldve gone for Demonetization  the day after the heist is complete MasterStroke

I was having a hard time to research on this as I cant readwrite Tamil and Google wasnt helpful either Would love to see any historians to shed some light in this matter for clarification also any English sources that I can learn more of Indias history


I would appreciate if anyone can point me to some trustable resources preferably in English Some people say its a political agenda that is what Karunanidhi tried to change 

My apologies if this is not the right subreddit for this topic Happy new year tho

TLDR When should Tamil New Year fall does it matter

Me and my friends think we will eventually have to do this in India even after lockdown is removed Also mass production and distribution of masks to all with take time 

 We all have time and can contribute to this by all making a DIY mask There are studies which clearly say that it reduces the growth rate of masks

Meanwhile a day earlier on th Gujaratbased firm CoSara had already received an approval to start manufacturing Covid test kits This firm is a collaboration between a USbased company  an Ahmedabadbased firm

CoSaras kits already have US FDA approval

Some of the other  firms who were waiting to get their Covid test kits validated said that these would be sold at a price of  per kit far cheaper than imported ones 

CoSara on the other hand refused to publicly divulge the cost of their Covid kits

Suddenly on st March the Health Ministry issued guidelines allowing private labs to conduct Covid tests The cost of these is capped at a whopping  rupees

These guidelines have one caveat  ONLY testing kits approved by US FDAEuropean CE can be used

That means ONLY kits manufactured by Ahmedabadbased CoSara can be used for Covid testing

So after allowing  firms to test their kits for production the Modi govt suddenly changed guidelines to favor ONLY  Ahmedabad company whose testing kit cost is unknown

Why is a Gujaratbased firm being provided a monopoly on Covid testing kits by suddenly tweaking guidelines overnight

Why are  firms who can produce testing kits for very cheap prices being blocked by these sudden new guidelines 

Ive Saket Gokhale filed an RTI to get more info 

Source httpstwittercomSaketGokhalestatus

httpstimesofindiaindiatimescomindiaindiantestkitsmaybenonstarterarticleshowcmsfrommdr

Update Now the health ministry in its press conference today has said that US FDA and EU CE approval arent mandatory So now Roche and CoSara are two companies who have the nod from them to manufacture and sell test kits But the question remains why they havent validated others as well Either reject their application or accept it why sit on it when test kits are badly needed

They told us to make Aadhar Cards which would be the singular identity for all citizens
We obliged

Then they told us to link our Aadhar Cards with our Banks Pan and Mobiles otherwise nothing would remain operational and also that everything would be more secure
We did it

 Baba Ramdev started selling noodles instead of teaching Yoga
We ate it

 National Anthem had to be sung before a movie
We sang along

 They told us that Rs and Rs  notes would be demonitised They advised us to exchange the old cash by standing in long queues day after day with a deadline threatening us They said Black Money would be recovered uncovered
We did it

Then came Rs notes
Earlier the markets would grumble when we fished out our Rs  or Rs notes and  wanted to change them
Now were doubly cursed trying to change our Rs   notes
Weve accepted that too

 Then one midnight they started the GST  Prices of goods went haywire
We digested it

 They told us to give up the subsidy on Cooking Gas 
Most of us did that tooexcept the top political leaders

 The countrys highest  Statue of Unity  was made with Rs crores of the tax payers money
We watched it

 Two businessmen fled the country with thousands of crores
We stood as silent spectators

 Cows blessed us with their dungs in front of our homes inspite of the huge money spent  on
  Swatch Bharat  program
We put up with it

 Local trains couldnt be run on time yet the bullet train was ushered in
We were taken for a ride

 Since  BSNL has been sick for years JIO entered the market asking us to light the funeral pyre of BSNL
We did it enthusiastically

 A top accused in the Sharada Scam became pure as lily just by defecting
We watched amused

 One accused of terrorism became an MP
We voted

 Cow urine cost more than a bottle of mineral water
We lapped it up

 A highly profitable PSU like BPCL  is about to be privatised
We noted it

 Unemployment rate is highest in  years
Still counting

 Onion costs more than Chicken
Switched to vegetarian meat

 Lets go back to the first point
They are again asking for documents to prove our citizenship
We are left wondering

 I rejoiced when their prime minister got imprisoned 

 I rejoiced when their image in the world was reduced to a terrorist nation 

 I rejoiced each time our cricket team won against theirs 

 I rejoiced when their diplomatic relationships were shattered 


As I walked in the mist of ignorance rarely did I see the hypocrisy of my own country and how could I It was so pure and true How can Mother India be anything but holy 


And as the mist grew thick I saw the hate crimes against the Muslims of our country I felt infuriated for I was taught to conjure brotherhood towards all the people of my beloved country
But how could I 
Was I not supposed to discriminate against the Muslims for that is what my ever so righteous parents did
All I was but a green child and so I kept quiet 



 I kept quiet as they were killed for eating beef 

 I kept quiet as their fortunes were stripped away by the mobs of unruly 
 I kept quiet as the government increasingly drifted away from harbouring secularism 
 I kept quiet as hate crimes became rampant
 I kept quiet as students were harassed 



But now the Eastern wind blows wild and the mist falls As my eyes adjust to the darkness I grow grave with fear that my beloved country is becoming the very thing I was taught to despise 

Was I not taught the virtues of secularism 
Was I not taught the value of equality 
How can I let my country become the pit of what it stood on


 No I shall not keep quiet any longer

 Why only these  countries  And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations Ans These  countries have a track record of pervasive systematic  institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus Sikhs Jains Buddhists parsis  Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

 What about Sri Lankan tamils Ans  The war has been over for the a decade now  There never was any persecution on religious lines It was on racial faultlines And over the decades of civil war the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

 Doesnt India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees Ans Yes it does And it is not shying away from it But it has no obligation to offer citizenship Each country has its own rules for naturalization India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law It will play host to them under UN rules in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve But in the case of Minorities from these  countries this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these  countries is never going to improve

 Why shouldnt Baluchis Ahmediyas in Pakistan Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness Ans They will be considered under the existing laws Not under the special category



Now lets address them 

Does the CAB Bill affect IndiansHindus Muslims anyone Ans No It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

Thats blatantly false The CAB automatically gives citizenship to nonMuslims even if they are illegals The BJP will then impose a nationwideNRC Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship 

NRC will follow after CAB Amit Shah said this himself httpstwittercomDilliDurAststatus

Heres Amit Shah saying nonMuslims wont even need to submit documents for NRC since theyll be given citizenship anywayhttpstwittercomDilliDurAststatus

Does this mean that Muslims from these  countries can never get Indian citizenship Ans No But they will go thro the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro naturalization rules years of residence etc

India is not a party to the  Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the  Protocol nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those  countries to come to India They can never get Indian citizenship 

Does this mean that Muslims from these  countries can never get Indian citizenship Ans No But they will go thro the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro naturalization rules years of residence etc

No they dont have to go through the usual process of acquiring citizenship They are undertrial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act  Under this law illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country They dont get citizenship 

Why only these  countries  And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations Ans These  countries have a track record of pervasive systematic  institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus Sikhs Jains Buddhists parsis  Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

Among our neighbouring countries Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils Burma of persecuting Muslims and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims So no those three countries are not special 

What about Sri Lankan tamils Ans  The war has been over for the a decade now  There never was any persecution on religious lines It was on racial faultlines And over the decades of civil war the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

Thats not the point The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act 

 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship Amendment Act that excludes themhttpswwwthenewsminutecomarticlecitizenshipactaftermathsrilankantamilrefugeeslivefeardeportation

Doesnt India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees Ans Yes it does And it is not shying away from it But it has no obligation to offer citizenship Each country has its own rules for naturalization India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law It will play host to them under UN rules in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve

All completely false As answered above India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules We are legally not required to before CAB host any refugees 

But in the case of Minorities from these  countries this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these  countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations A better and more diplomatic approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistanhttpswwwindiatodayinindiastorybangladeshindiacitizenshipamendmentbillpakafghanistanmodihasina


Why shouldnt Baluchis Ahmediyas in Pakistan Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness Ans They will be considered under the existing laws Not under the special category

Again false there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India We are deporting them

This is the first time Im posting here Ive been a silent reader for many years

I am here to highlight the tragic state of dentists and other medical professionals in India The intention is not to rant but to raise awareness so that the readers can share this perspective with their friends and family some of whom may want to rethink their plans for a medical career staying in India 

My friend is a dental BDS graduate from the best ranked dental college in the country After th he joined a good engineering college Tier  because of the pressure he faced from his parents but he was passionate about medicine and managed to get admitted into a BDS course after struggling for  year in engineering He is currently a resident doctor at the hospital in his college and treats over  patients a day I admire his stamina and dedication

Since his fellowship ends in a few months he was on the lookout for jobs in the private clinics govt clinics dont give jobs these days After interviewing with some of the most wellknown clinic chains he came to me and shared his misery   
Private clinics offer Rs   a month for  hours work 

Yes you read that right In some clinics it goes upto Rs  I was shocked to hear these figures One can earn more by working as a cabdriver in any city   
In most countries dentists are amongst the highest paid professionals Yet in India they have to live on a povertylevel salary My friend spends more than a few thousands every quarter to buy new tools because they need to be replaced to maintain hygiene standards He has helped hundreds of patients including critical cases overcome their misery People visit him from villages hundreds of kilometers away And he gets offered  a month To put that into perspective a dental clinic charges more than  for a root canal treatment which takes just  day of his time 

When we were discussing the reason for this he said that the Govts had opened up thousands of unregulated dental and medical colleges and the graduates from these places dont get any clinical experience Hence many of them work for free at the clinics Most clinics dont distinguish between the quality and capability of the doctor they just want someone with a degree and patient satisfaction is just not a concern He said that even MBBS graduates from state universities work for k a month in many places 

Hearing this I am actually sad that we keep saying that there arent enough doctors whereas the problem seems to be the total absence of regulation of the industry Now that the Govt is increasing the number of seats and allowing paramedics to work as clinicians the problem will get worse Already many dentists work for free and I wont be surprised if in the future you might have to pay to work as a dentist in a clinic   
 If anyone you know wants to pursue dentistry as a career or even medicine please let them know this side of the profession Thank you",530

I hope youre all safe during the lockdown 

Im your typical engineer whos pursuing a degree in one of the core branches And though I am not miserable at quantitative aptitude I just feel I am not a cut out for doing that I am literally scrapping through my engineering degree copying one assignment at a time and cheating my way through tests I feel like an imposter and think of myself as a failure whos about to become an engineer without even knowing the basic concepts 

My only passions are writing and somewhat web designing I have monetized both of my passions and earn some spare change through that Recently I have been exploring journalism a lot and I feel that a media house is where I belong I simply love the idea of giving a voice to people who are yearning to be heard I want to cover stories make documentaries and write news features from the remotest places on this planet 

Now the problem is due to my nonjournalism background no media house has ever reverted back to my emails asking for apprenticeship I dont know how to switch careers and I need help and this pandemic doesnt make it any easier Here are my main queries

 What do media companies specially digital publications like VICE The Wire etc look for in an apprentice 
 How to build a journalism portfolio without having any formal training in it 
 How do I approach these companies Should I slide inro HRs DMs LinkedIn or should I mail on their careers email 
 How to make this move a permanent one Is an MA in journalism required Should I move out of country to study

Im an American who was dating a guy from India Were both in our late s hes Catholic from Kerala and we had been dating for over a year

He flew to India to visit his family last September He said he wanted to go early in the year so that we could spend Christmas and New Years together But instead he started ghosting me for a couple of weeks and when I wouldnt stop texting him as I was worried he finally replied with a long breakup text He said his parents were retiring and so he was moving back to India forever to help his parents move and said he had no choice but to break up with me and wants me to move on

I recently found out from his Whatsapp photo that it wasnt true at allin reality he just got married and hes still working in the states I have not attempted to contact nor confront him since before he dumped me via text message  his text was the last piece of communication between us

Ive read in passing that its not unheard of for NRIs to dump their foreign girlfriends right before they tie the knot with someone in their community so easily like its some sort of past time And then it becomes this deep dark secret they laugh about with their mates after work Please tell me this isnt true When I told our mutual Indian friend about this he the friend was more in disbeliefshock by the fact that it happened to me rather than what had happened

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube and wanted your advice on how to proceed

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar in July PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel with K followers on YT I was supposed to get an Oppo R pro I was really excited and messaged him my email ID He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within  hours or else I get disqualified and I sent him my details

Several months passed by I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status He finally replied on st November saying I will get back to you soon No reply since

xB

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply but no response

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners which really pissed him off He says and I quote We dont ignore anyone You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened You had won the R Pro  once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment 

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month And he calls me a spammer for thatIts a blatant lie and whats worse Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him

Please advise what I should do next Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweetsI have provided proofs of my emails here I have always been patient and polite to him

email proofs httpsimgurcomaCOYUVhttpsimgurcomaCOYUVhim declaring me as the winner on YT  httpsimgurcomafUAbyhttpsimgurcomafUAby

My tweet which eventually forced his reply httpstwittercomCri_statushttpstwittercomCri_status

Note His twitter handle is httpstwittercomamitbhawanihttpstwittercomamitbhawani and he is the owner of Phoneradar

Thanks

Update I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team He apologizes and says its not Amits fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone I am really pissed off at this point Silly excuse but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for thisThey are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend Told him I dont care uch about the phone now Oh and this reddit post made a lot of noise Thanks rindia He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets Thats ridiculous 

Update  He deleted his tweet 

Update  As you all might have seen from his recent tweet I got an email from him apologizing for the issue Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page It hasnt been updated with winner names for a while now 

Update  RIP inbox

Thanks sideonion for the gold Really appreciate it Thanks to Anon for the silver

Update  Finally got the phone today Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September got the phone on my birthday today

Thank you so much rindia for all the support in making this happen All your comments here and on Twitterand on YouTube too made it possible for me to finally get the phone Proud of the community Thank you ",607

AW Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century  and he discovered that the latter could be explained by a the level of unemployment and b the rate of change of unemployment

Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high and there are few unemployed workers employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly However when demand for labor is low and unemployment is high workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate and as a result wage rates fall very slowly

A second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment If business is booming employers will bid more vigorously for workers which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast pace ie percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing eg percentage unemployment is unchanging or only increasing at a slow pace

Does this mean the current governments quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up 

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest  However during times of inflation  investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal 

During Congress years of   high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption  it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation  Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high  as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


As these examples of hyperinflation show states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check For the past century in the US the approach has been to manage inflation using monetary policy To do so the Federal Reserve the US central bank relies on the relationship between inflation and interest rates If interest rates are low companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business earn a degree hire new workers or buy a shiny new boat In other words low rates encourage spending and investing which generally stoke inflation in turnBy raising interest rates central banks can put a damper on these rampaging animal spirits

So I first saw this boy around  years old  at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off The way he stands the way he looks Dressed poorly didnt eat for a long time selling fruitsflowers roadside from morning to night 
I wanted to talk to him but he didnt first few days I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him

 Finally couple of weeks later he started talking and i  cried that whole day His parent died when he was too young to talk Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school they took him to another cities bus stand and left

Its been  months Ive been helping him in all the possible ways with study material food and neccesory cloths He dont want to go to any anathalay as well 

There is a couple in mid s I know very well and when i talked about him they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility

Finally he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care

All my rants about life just vanished Problems are still there I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words

We were surprised to see cities with very good education decent health and lots of jobs for the population An Englishspeaking tourist guide in Vietnam without a degreee earns more than  rupees a month A decent restaurant meal costs less than  rupees with all sorts of seafood included Even in the remotest villages we found good schools with playgrounds Small factories producing handicraft garments and small electronic devices are throughout the countryside 

The most important feeling was that of Hope Vietnamese people want progress and want to be leader in manufacturing and later innovation  

My parents said that they were sad that India was a much better country during the time they grew up There was hope and there was a feeling of pride in how we were using the little resources in the puursuit for our national development Today the narrative in India is centered on religion caste and other useless nonsensical factors How are you going to get jobs because there arent many factories which are exporting goods to the developed countries We import even edible oil and onions 

I have a deep fear that India will not even manage to become like Vietnam in the next  years In Vietnam there was a Subway being constructed The entire area was covered to prevent dust from coming out and the roads were pretty decent We traveled over  kilometers in the countryside and did not witness more than  to  kaccha houses You may blame communism for destroying the world but it seems that some socialistic aspects are necessary to create a thriving economy like education and and decent infrastructure 

We spent less than  INR per person and got to experience luxury hotels great sea food and amazing nature We spent the same amount in Goa in  and got to live in budget rooms eat stale sea food and go on overhyped tours that were crowded and chaotic 

My parents also agree that it doesnt make sense to Holiday in India anymore because you can get a better experience in countries like Malaysia Indonesia Vietnam or Thailand


 If us common people are thinking like this imagine how investors are thinking India is not an investment destination because we do not have the resources to create the infrastructure and culture of hospitality that other countries offer Foreigners have to register at some police station or foreign office and pay double or triple the price for entering a tourist destination 

Tourism is the second largest employer globally This experience taught us that India gets less than  million tourists and Vietnam gets more than  million tourists for a reason India is being disrespectful of what the world is really thinking about us  We think we were great  years ago so we are great today That is false India is going into a downward spiral of chaos",541

On th December  US President Nixon redirected the th Navy Fleet led by the  ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise the most powerful warship in the world at that time to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the IndiaSoviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on th December  under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote We are too late the Russians are already here
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed Americas mind and they retreated

Russia further went on to say A war on India will be considered a war on Russia and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang a region in China if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world

Thats the reason a Russian president has never set foot in Pakistan",386

Demo Demohttpsgithubcomwrapawaybigbasketnotifierblobmasterscreenshotsdemogifrawtrue

Detailed Installing Instructions Documentationhttpsgithubcomwrapawaybigbasketnotifierinstallation


This program gives you a system notification crossplatform Windows Linux OS X whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address


 Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online However due to the excess demand delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address



Some of the key features includes

 Cross platform system wide notifications
 You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself
 Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once
 Logging enabled by default for better debugging
 Configuration flexibility regarding various options
 Program doesnt do any javascriptrendering via headless browsers or anything
 Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that arent needed per se

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems However if you have any ideas to improve the section  Feel free to send a PR

The program is completely open source such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at Githubhttpsgithubcomwrapawaybigbasketnotifier

If youve any issues in using program or find any bugs or any other query contact me on twitter at uguptahttpstwittercomuguptastatus

httpsnpredditcomrCoronaviruscommentsflpdvmark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is  Im not sure exactly but messed up Didnt save any money kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and wont be nationalised

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised 

Anyway I want to know what the policies are like in India If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations Is buying your own stock also legal in India 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation That will be greatly appreciated

I cant help but rationlize why I was struck My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasnt the right for the cop to hit me as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog My friend btw is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country Was it right for the cop to strike me I cant help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I shouldve worn a mask and this whole thing wouldnt have happened What do you guys think

Edit Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through I didnt mention this but I am sort of new to India I came here like last year to complete my UG so I didnt take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised ie Middle East I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask however I dont think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place 

Neither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he wouldve conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first As far as Ive heard the cops in this country are far from the best but I shouldnt judge them individually based on what I may have heard but I cannot deny what Ive heard or read anyway",409

Looks like new after  years

The Nano is amongst the most famous Indian engineering products globally Yes a lot of folks in India shun the car because it makes them feel cheap and theyd rather buy a  lakh rupee bike or an expensive car on EMI to look cool But when I did my MBA abroad the Nano was the only Indian case study that was taught People abroad love to investigate the innovations in the Nano and at the same time look at it as a marketing failure because it did not highlight the aspirational value associated with owning a car in India

 years of ownership experience has been great Tata service in the area I live in is superb better than Hyundai and Maruti They take the car from our house for service and deliver it back at no extra cost

The Nano is a marvel not only because of its price but because of the space it offers and the extremely innovative packaging You wont feel tired even after fullday drives which is not the case in most small cars The AC is superb the fuel efficiency is around  in the city and over  on highways

I wish Tata takes the lessons of the Nano forward and brings out more innovative products Sadly in India innovation does not sell People are more concerned about looking rich

httpspreviewredditvmgjgubpbsspngwidthformatpngautowebpsdffeaceccecbdecbe

Tl dr

In todays speech announcing the extension of Indias national lockdown till rd May  the countrys Prime Minister requested citizens to download the Aarogya Setu applicationhttpswwwnewscomnewstechpmmodisaysaarogyasetuappiscriticalinthefightagainstcovidhereishowitworkshtml Unfortunately the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation strict purpose limitation transparency and accountability IFFs Working Paper analyses the application highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks

Background

On April   IFF released its working paper called  Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID in IndiahttpsdrivegooglecomfiledUKrElhcdPTYfYPcCgQKKpQBeOXview A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called Aarogya Setu

IFFs working paper was alert to this and Chapters  devote significant space in studying the emergent government and nongovernment practices standard setting processes and first principles in the space Chapter  of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Governments Trace Together application MITs Private Kit Safe Paths initiative and Aarogya Setu

What is Contact Tracing

According to the WHO contact tracing occurs in three steps namely a contact identification b contact listing and c contact follow up In particular contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R R naught which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies However with the ubiquity of smartphones which collect vast troves of personal information governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance both with cell tower data and with GPS signals   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a users device comes in contact with another users device When a user of the app is detected to have Covid contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks  


Whats the Risk   


With the creation of such systems come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance Critically India lacks a comprehensive data protection law outdated surveillance and interception laws or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform In domains like disaster relief  most apps which are purported as contact tracing technologies they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between snake oil and quality technology products These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones Specifically it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits If such systems wrongly urge people to preemptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems

How to prevent these risks

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others

 The usage of these applications should be voluntary
 All data should always be stored locally on peoples devices
 This data must be encrypted
 No Government can access it at a later point so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
 Governments must appreciate that any data from location information to proximity confirmations to health status to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information
 Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded all data is encrypted pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is voluntary and based on consent Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention  


Therefore we need to adhere to two principles

 Strict limits  in terms of collection and duration every step of the way and
 Comprehensive evidencebased justifications every step of the way

Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT

httpspreviewredditzwssbssjpgwidthformatpjpgautowebpsfcadaeaebeadb

Consider the following aspects

Is this for disease control or for other purposes

In other countries health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID For example in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited datainteraction which is shared with them European authorities are making similar commitments They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein

In India multiple committees have been set up in the context of Aarogya Setu or other technology responses to the coronavirus But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players

To protect peoples right to privacy countries including Singapore say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines Aarogya Setu retains the flexibility to do just that or to ensure comply legal orders and so on

Minimisation What Minimisation

 Singapore monitors peoples interactions through Bluetooth beacons MIT does it through GPS and then theres India which uses both
 Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier Indias Aarogya Setu collects multiple data points for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service TOS and Privacy Policy Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency This may include an accompanying manifesto technical specifications general FAQs and even its source code Not only does Aarogya Setu go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny information security and other related research which help facilitate stability

Similarly the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID positive as admitted in the apps Terms of Service We ask in our report the question in our paper does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test Similarly does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report

No Accountability and No Auditability

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Governments processes are compliant with the right to privacy

Second the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a  day time period However as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted peoples personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend

Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy  The Anonymisation Gambit

Finally the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture People are describing the current times as  on steroids And with  we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the Aarogya Setu project Second there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance

Finally the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this This level of transparency is a minimum since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to peoples informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny

Conclusion

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies and the paper eventually sets out a series of  recommendations to ensure peoples informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought

This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking The landlord is a pretty chill uncle so I was surprised to hear him shoutingThe argument was pretty onesided though So I wake up and do my daily duties and thats when my mom comes to me to have a real talk 

She says that we havent paid the rent for about  months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place She says your father hasnt been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that shes been asking relatives and people she knows money to make ends meet
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that were deep in debt about  lakhs

A little background about my family
Were a family of three my father moved to this city in  because of his job reputed company and so did my mother after getting married Things were going pretty good until  when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off They were asking my father to transfer to another city but keeping my education in mind my parents decided its best for us to stay here so my father resigned My mother a teacher was also the earning member
At this point in the story my father is about  years old and my mother is around  years old and Im  years old My father lands a job in a different company its a different job than what hes used to he doesnt like it A few years later the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member She teaches Yoga as a home tutor My mother handled things for a few years Fast forward a few years my father joins my uncles company a completely different job this time and moves to a different city It has been this way for about  years now things were starting to get back on track but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he cant lick their boots for a petty job I was aware of this and I was in th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a  year training period after which Ill be considered an employee of the company 

Cut to the question
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time

I really adore my mother and father imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because shes afraid he might break down mentally My dad is already very depressed but he pretends he isnt and also on the brink of his retirement ageI have a job now and Ill be on the company payrolls as an employee from September

I dont want my mother to struggle anymore what can I do as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it",652

xB

The length of operational expressways in India stands at  km httpsiimgurcomFscRCipnghttpsiimgurcomFscRCipng

The length of operational motorways in Pakistan stands at  km httpsiimgurcomKdZpPbWpnghttpsiimgurcomKdZpPbWpng only the operational sections have been included in the calculations

Whereas the length of operational expressways in China stands at  km as of  with planned expansion to  km by  the list is as follows  httpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_NTHS_ExpresswayshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_NTHS_Expressways  httpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_Regional_Expressways_of_ChinahttpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_Regional_Expressways_of_China httpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_auxiliary_NTHS_ExpresswayshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiList_of_auxiliary_NTHS_Expressways 

xB

As it can be seen the operational length in all three countries is drastically different While China and India have a similar population China has a far longer expressway system which tends to be designed more efficiently fewer accidents with better quality more durable more stops along the way with more facilites and more lanes in general Pakistan on the other hand has th the population of India but has a longer motorway system but still it is far behind China

This isnt a very fair comparison as there are more things to consider Pakistan has a worse railway system than India and fewer airports even after adjusting for population Some motorways in Pakistan are of better quality than India but some are in worse condition like the halfcompleted M motorway and the M and M motorways arent of a similar quality China on the other hand has a far better railway system more airports etc than both India and Pakistan Although India and Pakistan are both working on their respective railway systems they are still behind Pakistan is taking Chinas help in doing so The need for longer expressways in China is crucial as its more than  times the size of India controlled area of  sq km vs   sq km while some highspeed railway routes arent as beneficial but China still funds highspeed railway lines which lead to losses due to integration of faroff provinces because of longer distances in some areas like in USA where airplanes are more preferred",344

Sadhgurus viewshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvRgVkZcPjY



 Right at the beginning of the speech Sadhguru admits that he hasnt read the act in its entirety His views are based on what he read in the newspapers and what is generally out there 

 Sadhguru repeats Amit Shahs lie that West Pakistan had  nonMuslims and  in Bangladesh He claims that nobody has perfect numbers but these numbers cant be totally wrong Expect that they are httpswwwindiatodayinindiastorypakistanbangladeshnonmuslimpopulationcitizenshipamendmentbillbjp A detailed analysis from Anand Ranganathan now editor at Swarajya Magazine httpswwwnewslaundrycomthevanishinghindusofpakistanademographicstudyfbclidIwARkKrkFaZjXsYDAUmTbJDdERCkKnBcTGuuQEBFzzQnKgq

 He claims that minorities were persecuted during the  war While not false this does paints a selective narrative The genocide leading up to the  war of Bangladeshi independence saw a large section of Muslims killed as well httpsenwikipediaorgwiki_Bangladesh_genocide

 Sadhuru claims that unlike India other read Pakistan and Bangladesh have religious discrimination built into their legal framework This is demonstrably false in the case of Bangladesh as the constitution of Bangladesh expressly forbids the state to discriminate on the basis of religionhttphrlibraryumneduresearchbangladeshconstitutionpdf See Art     Pakistan does have religious discrimination as only a Muslim can become the prime minister or the president but Bangladesh does not have such limitations 

 Sadhguru claims that Hindu marriages dont have legal recognition in Pakistan This is no longer since  the case httpswwwbbccomnewsworldasia He even claims that he asked several people and they confirmed it which is weird since the truth is but a google search away

 Sadhguru falsely claims that India does not have blasphemy laws httpsenwikipediaorgwikiBlasphemy_lawIndia though to be fair to him blasphemy is not punishable by death in India and the laws are used to harass people of all religions 

 He claims that  million Bangladeshi Hindus were killed in the  war Thats an iconic figure in Bangladeshi culture and is often questioned httpswwwthehinducomopinionleadquestioninganiconicnumberarticleece Regardless the genocide as I mentioned earlier not only Hindus were killed There Pakistani Army was brutal against Bangladeshi Muslims demanding independence as well Bihari Muslims were also persecuted by the Bengalis their woes are often forgotten 

 He claims that Assam has been overrun by refugees and the refugee population in Assam is bigger than the local population This is staggeringly false as even the Assam NRC which has been criticised as draconian could only find  lakh people who came to Assam after  from a population of  crore 

 He claims that people are protesting because they dont want to give refugee to anyone While this may be the case in Assam the majority of the country is protesting because we believe that the CAA is discriminatory in nature as it introduces a religious filter for acquiring Indian citizenship 

 Sadhguru then claims that CAA only gives citizenship to those facing religious persecution This is again false as CAA simply assumes that anyone who is Hindu Sikh Christian Jain Buddhist or Parsi has faced religious persecution The phrase religious persecution is not even present in the act 

 Sadhguru excuses the police violence by claiming that when a few thousand protestors corner  policeman and thrash them it is only natural that these protestors will face the consequences of their actions when a bigger police force arrives He further justifies the police action by claiming that even if not all the protestors were throwing stones it is only natural that everyone of them will be beaten up if there were incidents of stone throwing 

 He commends the police for showing restrain and not resorting to firepower We know that was not the case  Video suggesting shots were firedhttpswwwndtvcomindianewsdaysafterjamiaviolencedelhipoliceinvestigateshootingvideos  Protestors with bullet injurieshttpswwwndtvcomindianewsjamiaclashestwoprotestersadmittedtodelhihospitalwithbulletinjuriessaysofficial

 Refers to those protesting as illiterate masses of religious groups 

 He claims that people have been misinformed as the CAA does not take away peoples citizenship He completely omits the fact that people are protesting because of a genuine fear that combined with NRC CAA will be discriminatory towards Indian Muslims We see that this will already be the case in Assam where out of the  lakh that were left out of NRC the nonMuslims will be eligible for citizenship while the Muslims will not be 

 He parrots a list of documents that will be enough to prove your citizenship while ignoring the fact that the document with the most widespread reach in the country  aadhar  is not a proof of citizenship See httpswwwnewindianexpresscomnationdecaadhaarvoteridcardpassportnotproofofcitizenshipgovernmentofficialshtml



The fundamental problems with the CAA and NRC are as follows courtesy Student Bar Association NLSIUhttpsdrivegooglecomfiledEMPdXiKXbpReiWRcdpDpOgsBjpzsifview

 What is it Allows for immigrants from certain communities from Pakistan Bangladesh and Afghanistan to acquire citizenship 

 Evident Problems Muslims are excluded from acquiring citizenship solely on the basis of religion Furthermore definition of illegal migrants restricted to only three countries this excluding other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka Myanmar Nepal etc

 Why is this problematic Our Constitution envisages India to be a secular state This means that no distinction can be made between persons solely on the basis of religion Hence excluding Muslims expressly violates the secular nature of our Constitution

 Regional Restrictions There is no rational basis for restricting the countries from which inflow is allowed to Pakistan Bangladesh and
Afghanistan The amendment allegedly aims to protect persecuted minorities Then what about the Tamils from Sri Lanka the Rohingyas from Myanmar the Nepali Gorkhas and the Uighurs and Ahmadiyas facing persecution The amendment does not consider this

 What about the NRC The National Register of Citizens first implemented in Assam required a person to produce documents of her
ancestry in order to be eligible for citizenship This falls hard on even legitimate citizens due to lack of necessary documents Therefore even citizens can get excluded under the NRC like in Assam where over  lakh applicants were excluded from the final list

 NRC  CAA  a double threat Now if an Indian citizen gets excluded under the NRC and if she is a non Muslim she can claim citizenship under the CAA However if she happens to be a Muslim then CAA ensures that she will not be granted citizenship as a naturalised migrant

Sadhguru fails to address even a single criticism of the act while painting the protestors as people with no shred of sympathy for those fleeing religious persecution",1074

A  naans crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer  it is almost hollow in the middle no bready glutenous structures  image for reference httpsireddituealwdjpghttpsireddituealwdjpg   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal so a phulka like internal structure but with tandoors heat youd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that

Long version

Im  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors While most  recipes do the yeastyogurt the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan Ive seen   restaurants in European countries also do this so I guess they leaven   with yeast and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions this was my attempt httpsiimgurcomTjCnmsjpghttpsiimgurcomTjCnmsjpg

Going  back to naans in India however the crumb is more of a very airy   structure with just the top  bottom layers importantly it doesnt  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita  a perfect example  is httpswwwredditcomrBreaditcommentseujovfinally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_rotihttpswwwredditcomrBreaditcommentseujovfinally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water   salt  no diary and importantly no leavening  The more Im  understanding a  bit about bread etc the more Im feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor soda and not a yeast bread Does anyone have links  to  videosrecipes from actual Indian restaurants Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks where the recipe is either yeast baking   sodapowder but trying all of them still gives a more breadier  crumb   to naan while Im actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   rotis crumb except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there while a tawa rotiphulka has a great air   bubble while roasting but it doesnt sustain I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour dont have atta  so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans however it didnt stay after flipping similar to how a   chappatiroti on griddle would have bubbles but dont survive to stay   bubbled httpsimgurcomaFjPhUJhttpsimgurcomaFjPhUJ 

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterdays dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening

xB

I have been in this flat for nearly two years and have had no issues my landlord is extremely helpful and has no issues with me

xB

We were going to renew the agreement in few days after it expired but as we both were busy with work we had to wait for some holiday as it needs both our signatures and witness

xB

Due to the corona lockdown all this is put on a break the issue is can this cause us problems with the police and or the society

xB

As they are a bit more strict now and i heard that they are doing door to door check for corona

I am a foreigner but have been in India for nearly  years now and havent traveled out of India for all this time

Currently the cases are being managed by internal medicine and pulmonologist as the front line and other hospitalist like us are waiting in reserves  The wait is a nervewracking one We know that the numbers by the government arent accurate and the wave will come anytime anyday We are constantly checking the dashboard for the new cases trying to predict when that might be Its terrifying especially when we have stopped most of our daily routine work only emergencies are working and have all the time in the world to think and ponder 

The lockdown that was implemented was a good idea but its just delaying the inevitable Stopping a virus with Ro  approx is like trying to stop wind you can slow it down sure but not stop it Hospitals are trying to get PPE its ok atm Atleast here but when push comes to shove it will be like Stalingrad where conscripts were thrown in front of machine guns without rifles or ammunitions Testing is also very inadequate similar to what a war time goverment does to keep the morale up by not reporting bad news which I am sure isnt their intention here Testing criterias are ridiculous and labs dont test unless you follow them to the letter their hands are tied Outbreak in this country most likely wont be like Italy or the US We dont know how much worse this may get here Given the population density god help us 

We are starting to have desertion amongst our ranks Some have tried and got certificates from other doctors stating to have preexisting conditions and wont be able to work In response the Administration has appointed medical boards to look at such cases and decide the risk accordingly

I have never read any memoirs of someone in a losing side of the war It would have really helped to know how they fought this hopelessness and gloom that has disrupted our lives We are constantly hearing  horrific stories from American and Italian doctors in internet and it feels a window to our future in coming days or weeks I cant talk about this with my parents I have decided to keep them in dark about this as much as I can They are constantly checking the numbers in my city and hospital I think they also know whats coming

I can only hope for general winter Indian summer in this case to stop this overwhelming force or a successful clinical trial that could atleast give us something to fight with

PS 
 I honestly believe that the government did the best they could not only ours but across the world This is just too hard of a foe to best

It is ridiculous how people cant think rationally Appalling These are people I know and are generally sane I think common man doesnt have the ability to think beyond superficial logic And if you let mob justice prevail then you will be happy until you yourself are crucified But then again what do you expect in a society where elected representatives call for mob lynching of the accused This speaks more to our distrust in the proper rule of law in our country than anything else

Sorry for the rant but it is just so overwhelming that I cant ignore it When I try to put this alternate view point people accuse you of sympathizing with the rapists which is clearly not what I am trying to do Our nation is in deep crisis and call me a pessimist but I dont see a way out",228

httpswwwthelallantopcombherantekkavitarozpadhnalikhnaseekhobysafdarhashmihttpswwwthelallantopcombherantekkavitarozpadhnalikhnaseekhobysafdarhashmi

Woh Safdar Hashmi ki den hai He was born today

Safdar Hashmi was an activist and street theatre artist and later identified with the communist ideology as well

He was a turning point for street play and street theatre in India His work highlighting human rights and grassroots changes irked many in the establishment He openly mocked Indira Gandhis grab of power of the Emergency to government actions government apathy the plight of the poor and uneducated in India

He was killed while performing a street play after he was attacked by the goons of the Congress party

In later years the government played this very song as a public campaign on Doordarshan

Safdar was not killed due to his ideology He was killed because he raised his voice he mocked the establishment He inspired people to be aware of their rights to question

This is the story the world over This is today as well TOdays deaths get whitewashed by a pliant media that does not mean fundamental issues dont exist today Or that we have benevolent Gods in power in the government

Narendra Dabholkar MM Kalburgi Govind Pansare  Gauri Lankesh are grim reminders today

As the news of the epidemic becoming severe I decided to go back to BangaloreIndia

This is where the fun starts
 ON FEBRUARY  I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he lets me go No temperature checks
 at immigration the officer doesnt check my travelvisa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 

A week later I have a bad cold I have a weak immunity and since I have a crazy travel history and didnt want to take risk and endanger people so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi I didnt and they disconnected
So I went to the official government center Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital and report myself
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest Xray and they found airblockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumoniaSo I was isolated and quarantined

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital held me in quarantine for  days until my results came back negative for the virus

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and youre away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr

TLDR 
 travelled around a lot
 officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
 felt sick reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
 quarantine was not bad at all
 results for covid came back negative 

If you have symptoms report yourself",435

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi Karnatka climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi Uttar Pradesh feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity as I become just another body in the crowd

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar Kerala the light rain on my skin and feeling inner peace

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal because I was overcome by beauty and grief

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu Himachal Pradesh and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down

Getting tremendous help from like  different beautiful people whenever I needed something all over this country

And finally quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna Bihar and finally accepting that its time to go back home

 At pm on August   Akku Yadav was lynched by a mob of around  women from Kasturba Nagar It took them  minutes to hack to death the man they say raped them with impunity for more than a decade Chilli powder was thrown in his face and stones hurled As he flailed and fought one of his alleged victims hacked off his penis with a vegetable knife A further  stab wounds were left on his body The incident was made all the more extraordinary by its setting Yadav was murdered not in the dark alleys of the slum but on the shiny white marble floor of Nagpur district court

 Laughed at and abused by the police when they reported being raped by Yadav the women took the law into their own hands A local thug Yadav and his gang had terrorised the  families of Kasturba Nagar for more than a decade barging into homes demanding money shouting threats and abuse

 Residents say he murdered at least three neighbours and dumped their bodies on railway tracks They had reported his crimes to the police dozens of times Each time he was arrested he was granted bail

 He violated women to control men ordering his henchmen to drag even girls as young as  to a nearby derelict building to be gangraped

  Prominent among their supporters were  lawyers based in Nagpur who issued a statement saying the women should not be treated as the accused but as the victims 

 One retired high court judge even congratulated the women In the circumstances they underwent they were left with no alternative but to finish Akku The women repeatedly pleaded with the police for their security But the police failed to protect them said Justice Bhau Vahane

 On the day of Yadavs hearing  women came to the court armed with vegetable knives and chilli powder As he walked in Yadav spotted one of the women he had raped He called her a prostitute and threatened to repeat the crime against her The police laughed She took off her sandal and began to hit him shouting We cant both live on this Earth together Its you or me

I dont want to end up in a corporate setup I sometimes doubt whether thats just because Im shirking responsibility or I lack ambition but I think I have a few things figured out that I dont want to compromise on  reading and keeping a healthy life which for me is basically an hour of running and basic exercises and also that I dont care much for things like say a car or a hugeass house

Keeping these things in mind I wish to figure out a career which affords me this kind of a lifestyle and theres a balance between my interest in the job  the pay that Ill be getting from working it Now that Ive written it down it sounds like its too much to ask for but I believe it isnt entirely impossible Would really appreciate ideas helping me move forward in this direction thanks",205

The Jallianwala Bagh massacre also known as the Amritsar massacre took place on  April  when Acting BrigadierGeneral Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh Amritsar Punjab killing at least  people including men and women Over  people were injured

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre

 The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act This act was passed in February 
 The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion
 The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries
 Protesting against the act the Indians observed a hartal on March th and April th of 
 On April   two famous leaders Dr Kitchlew and Dr Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act
 Two days later on the th of April  General Dyer took command of troops He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
 Though the proclamation was issued no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it
 The gathering had no political intent at all It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi  the Sikh festival
 Anywhere between  and  people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day
 The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi
 Though the festival was a Sikh festival many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh
 Apart from the main entrance there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings This is a major reason for the high number of casualties
 Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting
 According to records the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing
 The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition
 The shooting was followed by the proclamation of martial lawhttpswwwbritannicacomtopicmartiallaw in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
 Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 
 Gandhi was initially hesitant to act but he soon began organizing his first largescale and sustained nonviolent protest satyagrahahttpswwwbritannicacomtopicsatyagrahaphilosophy campaign the noncooperation movementhttpswwwbritannicacomeventnoncooperationmovement  which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle
 Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the British RajhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiBritish_Raj such as members of the House of LordshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiHouse_of_Lords He was however widely criticised in the House of CommonshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiHouse_of_Commons whose July  committee of investigation censured him
 The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident the Hunter Commission which in  censuredhttpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarycensured Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military
 The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre Shingara Singh died in Amritsar on June   at the age of 
 The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 
 This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
 Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been confronted by a  revolutionary army to which Major General William Beynon replied  Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
 Both Secretary of State for WarhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSecretary_of_State_for_War Winston ChurchillhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiWinston_Churchill and former Prime Minister H H AsquithhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiH_H_Asquith  however openly condemned the attack Churchill referring to it as  unutterably monstrous while Asquith called it one of the worst most dreadful outrages in the whole of our history
 Winston Churchill in the House of Commons debate of  July  said  The crowd was unarmed except with bludgeons It was not attacking anybody or anything When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it  it tried to run away Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square with hardly any exits and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies the people ran madly this way and the other When the fire was directed upon the centre they ran to the sides The fire was then directed to the sides  Many threw themselves down on the ground the fire was then directed down on the ground This was continued to  to  minutes and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion
 After Churchills speech in the House of Commons debate MPs voted  to  against Dyer and in support of the Government
 The General Dyerled massacre at Amritsars Jalianwalla Bagh in   left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians
 Colonel Michael ODwyer was shot dead on  March  by a man named Udham Singh a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre
 The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than  injured with approximately  dead
 Indian nationalist Swami ShraddhanandhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSwami_Shraddhanand wrote to Gandhi of  deaths in the incident

 Shaheed Uddham Singh

 Shaheed Udham Singh  December    July  was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael ODwyer the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India on  March 
  While in custody he used the name Ram Mohammad Singh Azad which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anticolonial sentiment 
 Shaheed Uddham Singh waited  years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province General  Michael ODyer
 While awaiting his trial Singh went on a day hunger strike and was forcefed On  June 
 When asked about his motivation Singh explained

I did it because I had a grudge against him He deserved  it He was the real culprit He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people so I have crushed him For full  years I have been trying to  seek vengeance I am happy that I have done the job I am not scared of  death I am dying for my country  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule I have protested against this it was my  duty What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death On  July  Singh was hanged at Pentonville PrisonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiPentonville_Prison

 Following his conviction he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press However political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association GB ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism

I say down with British Imperialism You say India do not have peace We have only slavery Generations of socalled civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating known to the human race  All you have to do is read your own history If you have any human decency about you you should die with shame The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the socalled intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood     
  
At this point he was interrupted by the judge but after some discussion he continued  
  
I do not care about the sentence of death It means nothing at all  I do not care about dying or anything I do not worry about it at all I  am dying for a purpose Thumping the rail of the dock he exclaimed  We are suffering from the British Empire Udham Singh continued more quietly I am not afraid to die I am proud to die to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out to free my country  
  
I am standing before an English jury I am in an English court  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons We come to England and we are sentenced to  death  
  
I never meant anything but I will take it I do not care anything about it but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India All your British Imperialism  will be smashed Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your socalled flag of democracy and  Christianity flies  
  
Your conduct your conduct  I am talking about the British government I have nothing against the English people at all I have more English friends living in England than I have in India I have great sympathy with the workers of England I am against the Imperialist  Government  
  
You people are suffering  workers Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs these mad beasts India is only slavery  Killing mutilating and destroying  British Imperialism People do not read about it in the papers We know what is going on in India  
  
At this point the judge refused to hear any more but Singh continued  
  
You ask me what I have to say I am saying it Because you people are dirty You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India  
  
He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted  
  
Down with British Imperialism Down with British dirty dogs  
  
He turned to leave the dock spitting across the solicitors table

xB

His remains are preserved at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar Punjab  On every  July marches are held in Sunam by various organizations and every statue of Singh in the city is paid tribute with flower garlands

Firstly the police claimed that they provocative speech in the Elgar Parishad event which led to violence This wasnt proven and then they accused them of having maoist links and planning to assassinate Modi They remotely placed letters containing illintent against constitution on their laptop which indicated such things Few agencies including Amnesty and Caravan found out these irregularities The police presented their laptops to the court and court declared them guilty

 It basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way Basically makes it a number game which is Frankly ridiculous to me Someone with  hot guys in their profile wont be able to emotionally attach let alone choose between who they want Its one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to Its near impossible to find love where there isnt real time energy or connection involved  

 It raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys  since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe Men are probably as expendable as ever In real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is specialchance for a spark  Online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encountersI met my girlfriend in a library Sorry Im a hopeless romantic

The Ugly

 The excercise led to the death of several people and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population I dont feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post

A couple more points Id like to add

 Just because  of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesnt mean that the excercise was a complete failure The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation despite what the government says I believe the government got everyone on the blackmoney bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money Again just my theory
 I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring more transparency and accountability to the economic system in addition to making more and more of India tax compliant and a part of the formal economy I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role particularly in the times of economic crisis but thats a story for another day

Summing up Id like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure It has its place in the grey neither black nor white as some people believe Thats the point of my post Thanks for readingPlease let me know if I missed anything and Id be happy to update my post",1154

The mortality rate in US is about  in Italy around  and in UK its more than according to the above article

so about  people die per  cases in India Its scary but not too much

currently mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases 

    mortality rate  Total Death  Total cases

currently in world  active cases and  deathsthe curve is nowhere near flat

mortality rate     worldwide

so about  people die per  cases worldwide Its scary still not too much

lets assume an infection ratehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpanish_flu of   percent of population would get infected in a span of  yearshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpanish_flumediaFile_spanish_flu_wavesgif  is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didnt spread to many country as covid the social distancing was not that great before and there were three waveshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiSpanish_flumediaFile_spanish_flu_wavesgif

xB

now  of  billion people is  billion very huge and  of  billion is  millionestimated death toll 

realistically if the infection rate is brought down to by social distancing lockdown etc the death toll would still be  million stay the fck inside home seriously

xB

now my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome eventually these people will either die or get cured

Doesnt it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation

    mortality rate  total dead  total discharged or curedtotal dead

In this case 

current mortality rate       thats huge numbers from worldometerhttpsimgurcomaEHZnAI

this changes everything

now if the infection rate is more likely estimate the death toll would be  millionholy fuck

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history 

In IndiahttpsimgurcomavOkmjyH 

mortality rate     which is very high above world mean why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate

Did gov officials know about this  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic

BTW the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the worldas far as i researched  they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor

xB

please help me with these questions

 Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable 
 Does India have huge asymptomatic cases which were not reported
 How did china contain this did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers 
 because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries their mortality rate by second method  only calculating outcomes is  while for the rest of the world is  it never crossed  at any timevery suspicious Their mortality rate is low all the way why all the country have similar curve except china 
 why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus  India should not follow Chinese model to contain this problemi know medical students who are lazy to do their maths 
 how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high R   for covid based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA has an R of  and roughly kills about  to    in  remember that this is the rate for an exponential graphchinese studyhttpswwwncbinlmnihgovbooksNBK   for comparison seasonal flu in USA has an R of  and roughly kills about  to    in httpswwwcdcgovfluaboutburdenhtml remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph
 how can we model this in India will India be fucked if there were a community spread

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a startup or taking jobs with high risk I am not saying that working at a  job is bad but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers right

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents

Having said that one thing I do feel we are neglecting is the economical part which might lead to bigger problems than the flu itself Even with the lockdown lifted labor that is gone wont be instantly back in fact I expect labor still in place will head for their homes this will be just the st step We are unable to immediately revive even our essential manufacturing facilities and this delay will lead to shortages increasing panic across the country This leads to a selffeeding issue ie the problems compounding due to not stopping a small problem leading to bigger and bigger ones I am in Punjab from my window I can see the fields ripe for harvest it was to be ramping up last week with full flow tomorrow it is looking very unlikely right now because of the lack of labor After the lifting of lockdown if it takes weeks upon weeks to get back to production the shortages will become more and more dire and in the following months we will see the fire that the tiny sparks in Surat Mumbai etc are trying to show bringing us face to face with fate in an abyss

The main reason for writing this isnt to point out our bad future or blame someone it is to suggest some basic resources we havent utilized till now some ideas Starting from the labor or our poorer brethren heading back it is because they feel outsiders in the place they are unable to receive help or the unknown scaring them for the future we solve this we start our work on solving our nonflu problems Right now at a time of limited resources we are using the bare minimums to seek out the needy Police delivering food we need to reverse this the needy need to come to the source Pyasa Kuey pe aye Kua pyase ke pass nai of course that is basically breaking the lockdown so what we need is something very accessible that wont lead to a breaking of curfew yet accessible enough for the needy to access The two things I can think of are police stations and post offices every neighborhood in our country has one of these nearby We should implement distribution of resources to the needy by them approaching the nearest one and collecting the resource this can be further closed down to the needy of station  area row  can send  person from  to  and row  from  to  so on If some needy are left they use the phone numbers and the resources are delivered by night This can also work for the harvest we need the labor willing to work to assemble at the local station maintaining social distance at a specific hour and the ones who need labor can sign them up or even not have a face to face have the labor register and the hirer registering at different times and the nearest ones matching are informed This can be implemented in a manner which minimizes the number of people outside at the same time put money into hands needing them if somebody is not hired then the info is already there and we utilize MNREGA and make sure everyone who needs work has income

We need to utilize the vast call center resources that our country has the call centers should be hired for a limited time by the government to answer calls and make calls so every citizen is in touch and knowledgably about their duties and fulfillment of their needs this has  benefits calling can be done from home phones have a very deep reach into the interior needy areas income start for the callers This should be done against a basic citizen database so info can added next to every name if they are good it says good if the have a need the need is mentioned then by level of severity the issues are handled by the required organization

Running out of room so lastly the biggest resource we are not utilizing is our citizens at home they can be put to use in many ways Ill give one example Our medical sector is facing a huge need of PPE equipment if you look at what this equipment it is something that can be made at home with resources we already have Standards might not be same but something is more than nothing The lack of visors for example how many of us have helmets at home simply remove the glass at front attach elastic and we have one visor ready if the government puts out a request we as a community can respond to what we can and what we make can be collected from houses and reach where needed We have so many professions essential sitting at home today Punjab got  tests that is a bit less than the testing required we need every chemist in the country to have the information needed to make the test if they can prepare it they do and government can collect 

These ideas might be the worst you have heard but what I am trying to get to is in a stereotype Indians are portrayed as IT nerds call center land or brainy we need to be utilizing these for basic ideas Only lockdown wont save us I would ask you try reach to whoever you can to try and spread the ideas I will try and get my idea to someone in authority if you want please write your solutions and post on Facebook twitter or whatever you have I am tired of reading our issues everyday in newspapers hopefully in a few days newspapers will be carrying information that can be utilized to solve a problem we are facing

We can do that or do nothing May the Planet heal and life thrive

e5rae3,india,Politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/India/comments/e5rae3,1630,353,2019-12-04 09:12:26,"Rant In India everything matters except the real issues Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important As an Indian international student after observing the Western European education system I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our elders The only problem is that many of our so called  elders are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws 

When I first went abroad I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my culture ritiriwaz after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months I literally had to touch the feet of  thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight Our parents have panick attacks if you dont say a proper namaste to a random aunty who you dont give a flying fuck about you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are forcefed the idea of andh deshbhakti you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family 

  
My point is simple I really do not mind culture traditions riti or riwaz I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture however I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems facts and logic that this country is so deprived of  

This is also where it gets really dark If you are someone who has ability to think critically or youre someone with a certain level of common sense living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism You dont touch the feet of your relatives You scoundrel You come late to a pooja Thats sacrilege You hang out with non vegetarian friends Chiee  You believe India can be more secular deshdhrohi 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of antiintellectualism in India It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as Whatsapp university and Facebook pathshala but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale Whatsapp university is not making us dumb it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you dont put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season Instead of blaming the municipality for this he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like bacche man ke sacche when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher you get harassed and abused mentally emotionally and physically 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids The more you travel around the world the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back And yes I know There are other countries that have the same problem however I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight and probably never will

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the cultured Indian society there is something wrong with you as a person   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news whatsapp twitter or even listen to my own relatives and friends I feel utterly nihilistic I hope things take turns for the better in India but I wont bet my money on it so because when you combine religion symbolism politics and fake superiority complex then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder",976
